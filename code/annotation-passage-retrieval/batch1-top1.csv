Raised in Buffalo, New York, she received her Bachelor’s Degree at Canisius College with a major in Pre-Medical Studies and a minor in Spanish Language & Culture. She then worked in healthcare as a Pharmacy Technician and a Medical Assistant in Dermatology, where she discovered her passion for treating conditions of the skin. She moved to Orlando, Florida in 2016 to pursue a Master’s Degree in Physician Assistant Studies from Nova Southeastern University, graduating with Highest Honors in 2018. Sara is certified by the National Commission on Certification of Physician Assistants and licensed through the Florida Board of Medicine. She is an active member of the Society of Dermatology Physician Assistants, the Florida Society of Dermatology Physician Assistants, and the American Academy of Physician Assistants.', 'The Physician Assistant Board or their representative may require proof or demonstration of competence from any physician assistant for any medical services performed. If a physician assistant determines a task, procedure or diagnostic problem exceeds his or her level of competence, then the physician assistant shall either consult with a physician or refer such cases to a physician. Click here to review a sample Delegation of Services Agreement. Question: What if a physician assistant works for more than one supervising physician at a hospital or clinic? Do we need to have separate DSAs for each supervising physician? Answer: The Board has had questions regarding how the DSA would be written if a physician assistant works for more than one supervising physician at a hospital or clinic. If the duties and medical services performed are consistent with each supervising physician, then one DSA can be written to include several supervising physicians. Each supervising physician must sign and date the DSA, along with the signature of the physician assistant. Question: What if a physician assistant works for one supervising physician who is an ob-gyn, and also works for an ortho supervising physician, and both are at the same clinic or hospital? Answer: If the duties and medical services provided by the physician assistant differ from one supervising physician to another, then it is recommended that a separate DSA be written for each supervising physician. However, one DSA could be used, but it would need to be separated with which duties are allowed under each supervising physician. Again, signatures and dates from all parties must be included on the DSA.']"

But if I give up on that dream, a hybrid online in-person EM NP program like Rutgers' will suffice. Honestly, I struggle with this every so often because I do see myself furthering my education but choosing a path is even more difficult since both PA and NP is available to me. That said, I'm leaning more towards NP (UC Davis' dual PA/NP and Rutgers' EM-FNP). Reason is, I enjoy instant gratification and don't like to play the waiting game or what-ifs (ie: OTP). I like to move around so obtaining a compact license as a RN/APRN can make such moves a lot more easier among other things. It sounds like you're leaning towards PA and that is okay. The medical model and PA school curriculum is definitely superior to majority of NP schools and that is a fact. But if you're willing to do the extra work as a NP-S; full-time clinical year, suture workshops, I&D workshops, U/S workshops, imaging workshops, etc, then you'll be more than prepared to enter the workforce. Better yet, a residency program. Either choice will provide a great work-life balance and income. PS: Each and every one of the PAs I work with in the ER are well-respected and function autonomously."", 'In addition to their role in the procedure itself, nurse anesthetists make many preparations for you before surgery. You can — and should — take an active role in these preparations by communicating and cooperating with your nurse anesthetist and your surgeon. There are several kinds of anesthesia. The one chosen for you is based on factors such as your physical condition, the nature of the surgery and your reactions to medications. Frank and open discussion with your nurse anesthetist is key in the selection of the best anesthetic for you. In particular, you must speak freely and follow instructions closely regarding your intake of medications, food or beverages before anesthesia. Such substances can react negatively with anesthetic drugs and chemicals. The preoperative interview is essential to effective communication. This confidential discussion with the nurse anesthetist prior to surgery provides information vital to your care. You may be given a questionnaire to fill out and bring along to the preoperative interview. Information supplied by the questionnaire assists your nurse anesthetist in doing the interview thoroughly and efficiently. Different types of patients or procedures may require different types of anesthesia. Pregnant patients should prepare before the onset of labor for the possibility of having an anesthetic, even if a natural childbirth is planned. During pregnancy, keep accurate records of allergies, high blood pressure, prescriptions and over-the-counter medications. The use of drugs, including recreational drugs and alcohol, can increase the risk of anesthetic complications for both mother and baby.', ""Do PAs make more than nurse practitioners? On average, yes. The BLS reports that the median annual wage for nurse practitioners was $109,820 as of May 2019 , while the median annual wage for physician assistants reached $112,260 during the same month. That said, income varies greatly in different locations and at different types of healthcare facilities. Can nurse practitioners and physician assistants prescribe medications? This question does not come with a clear cut answer. For the most part, yes. However, some states impose limitations on the type of medications that nurse practitioners and physicians assistants can prescribe. Those restrictions usually include schedule II medications, although each state sets different rules. What is the difference between nurse practitioner and physician assistant? Nurse practitioners and physicians assistants work in similar capacities. However, nurse practitioners come from a nursing background, while a physician assistant education comes from a medical learning model. They may also specialize in different categories. Physician assistants are more likely to go into a surgical specialty, for example, while nurse practitioners may focus on areas like adult-gerontology, pediatrics, or women's health.

Less than half remain in generalist primary care. For the earlier 1987 � 1990 grads, less than 20% can be found with medicine pediatrics as their primary specialty. Medicine pediatrics has twice the rural distribution of IM or PD at 16%, but this shrinks to less than 10% when the denominator includes all who matched into medicine pediatrics. Nurse practitioner data is often inadequate for national comparisons. Many studies involve surveys or selected subgroups. What is consistent for NPs is loss of half of graduates to primary care. For 39000 graduates surveyed, some 21000 FTE in primary care were produced and this is a broader definition of primary care than most. Numerous part time NPs and NPs with only part of their activities as primary care had to be summed up to obtain this total. The total does not allow for inactive NPs, other part time NPs, lower productivity, or continuing losses in primary care over time. The actual full time primary care NPs are lower. This and other data at AANP.org. Health policy, graduate degree focus, subspecialization, and MMC influences appear to have replicated physicians and their tendencies to avoid primary care and distribution. Physician assistants (PAs) have achieved Money Magazine ranking as the 5th best occupation in America. PAs are predicted to be in the top 10 in job growth in census projections to 2014. PA popularity may be a major reason for declines in primary care choices below 40%. Hospitals, surgeons, emergency rooms, and a host of subspecialists have discovered their utility. PAs are still undervalued by current employers and have discovered that it pays to switch employers. Higher income gains consistently above 10% are associated with changing away from primary care. Another interpretation is that lower paid (rural or underserved) PC practices are not able to pay enough to retain PAs. About 10% of PAs are inactive and 40% remain in PC. These losses may also be tracked by changes in supervising physicians. PAs working for FPGP physicians have declined from 40% to 28.5% in the past ten years and rural choices have declined from 25% to 17%. (http://www.aapa.org/research/index.html) These are significant steady declines in the distributions of all PAs that are likely to continue with current policies. The earliest PA and NP programs admitted a broad range of students, trained broadly and outside of MMCs (usually with FPs), and distributed.

Physician Assistants are licensed medical professionals who may work independently of the lead physician, while Nurse Practitioners are well trained, but not necessarily licensed caregivers, who must work under the close supervision of the attending doctor. Contrasts in Academic Preparation The differences between these two professions begin at the educational level. Physician Assistants must attend a PA program following graduation with a Bachelor’s degree. These Master’s level programs are extremely rigorous and are modeled on the curriculum found in medical schools. In fact, many of the courses like dermatology, hematology and psychiatry are found in both medical schools and Physician Assistant programs, although there is a less in-depth study of these subjects in PA programs. Although the level of comprehensiveness differs between medical schools and PA programs, they are both focused on the medical science.', 'Candidates seeking state licensure as PAs must generally hold a master\'s degree from an accredited school and national certification. Licensing Agency NPs seek licensure through a state board of nursing or board of medical examiners. The AANP provides links to the licensing agencies. PAs seek licensure through a state medical board, board of medical examiners, or similar agency. You can find a list of state licensing agencies through the National Commission on Certification of Physician Assistants (NCCPA). Recertification NPs must earn recertification every five years or less, depending on their population focus and credentialing entity. They may sit for the appropriate exam or complete a minimum 1,000 hours of clinical practice and 75-150 continuing education units in their NP specialty. PAs need 100 hours of continuing medical education (CME) hours every two years and an exam every six years . Details about the Job Nurse Practitioner Physician Assistant Practice Framework NPs often work with physician oversight. However, NP practice authority varies by state, and in almost half of states, NPs can possess full practice authority (FPA). View state-by-state NP practice authority status . PAs cannot work independently of physicians, although similar to NPs, there\'s a growing movement toward independent PA practice authority. Frequently Asked Questions Is NP higher than PA? Neither profession ranks ""higher"" than the other. Both occupations work in the healthcare field, but with different qualifications, educational backgrounds, and responsibilities. They also work in different specialty categories. In addition, although both nurse practitioners and physician assistants certainly work with more independence than nurses or aides, they still often need some sort of physician oversight.']"

Bathing after a certain period will help to remove different types of external parasites from their body. Regular bathing also helps to make the brushing and shearing process easier. For bathing, just wet the goat, use livestock or goat shampoo and rub, and finally rinse. Don’t forget to keep other goats far and using a collar while bathing. Brushing Regular brushing is a very important part of grooming a goat. You can perform regular brushing for removing dirt from the body of your goats. Use hard brush for angora goats. Don’t brush them during their feeding time. Nutrition Good nutrition play a very important role in raising angora goats for mohair production. Usually goats are both browsers and grazers. But they prefer browsing than grazing. Angora goats boast especially for their good browsing and foraging talents. Along with raising angoras as pet and for mohair, you can also use them for cleaning up your brushy or weedy areas. Your goats will live happily and produce their maximum, as long as they have sufficient browse. Notice the condition of the goat’s favorite plants, when pastures are short. Move your goats to an another pasture or start feeding them quality hay and cottonseed for protein, if there are insufficient browsing areas exist. Perform regular worming program for keeping them healthy and preventing fleece damage from parasites (such as lice). Along with nutritious feeding, always ensure supply of adequate amount of clean and fresh water according to the demand of your goats.', '2: Understand the Milk cycle: Goat internal system works like humans. If you want to get good amount of milk, make sure you goats have babies. This process boosts the milk production and when the goat gives birth, usually during spring, you can enjoy milk and sell the babies to earn more. You can use the same Doe again for giving birth to new offspring’s, but let her get fine for 2 to 3 months and do not take milk. She will get fine internally and later you can enjoy the frequency of milk and meat. 3: Know what you are buying: You need to know about the famous breeds of meat and milky goats – this would help you in making a perfect decision: Dairy breeds: The popular types include: Nubain Saanen Alphine Oberhasli La Mancha Meat breeds: They include: Spanish Boer Kiko Raising Boer goats is certainly more profitable because it’s hardy breed and also masses enjoy its meat, as it is tasty and healthy. Fancy breeds include Cashmere and Angora; while fun pet breeds include Fainting and Pygmy. 4: Buy baby goat – Doeling This is a cheaper way to increase your flock with less capital – however, babies are a little aggressive and afraid to manage in the new environment. Make sure you feed them with your own hands so that they are settled in the friendly environment.', 'Mohair from purebred Angoras is creamy white. Any other color comes from crossbred goats. Although crossbred mohair is generally inferior, it is appreciated by hand crafters who prefer natural colors. Mohair can be either combed into ""top"" and spun into worsted yarn for making sweaters and scarves, or carded into ""roving"" and spun into woolen yarn for coats and rugs. Cashmere is not a breed but the downy undercoat of some 68 different breeds having origins in cold climates. Good cashmere is at least 1 ½ inches long and comes in a variety of colors, including white. A commercial-grade goat averages pound per year; some animals produce three times that. -Advertisement- /1032081/MEN-InlineJumbo3 Cashmere begins growing after the summer solstice on June 21st, and begins shedding after the winter solstice on December 21st. It is harvested either by combing as fibers shed or by shearing before shedding starts. Combed cashmere has fewer coarse primary hairs to remove than sheared cashmere. After cashmere has been dehaired (by shaking out coarse hairs and picking out those that remain), it may be either teased or carded for spinning. For information on breeders, supplies, and other resources consult Angora Goats the Northern Way. Meat Goats Goat meat offers a tasty, low-fat, lowcholesterol alternative to beef, pork, or lamb. Called ""chevon,"" it has a unique, pleasant flavor that is comparable to fine venison or grass-fed beef. The meat of young goats, called ""chevrette"" (""cabrito"" in the Southwest) tastes a little like veal.']"

It is also observed in nerve ending to joints, Chestwall, blood vessel and also heart .They act like pressure as well as vibratory receptors * The exact reference for Paccinian corpuscle to be present within the heart is not available to me. Readers may contribute, Importance of age and gender and IQ Palpitation is primarily a symptom of young age where the heart is supple and more dynamic. Women tend to perceive more for some unknown reason. Elderly people rarely complaint about palpitation .It could imply aging with or with out autonomic dysfunction which suppresses transmission of palpitation signals to brain.Chest wall thickness also matters. My guess would be, Chest wall thickness, epicardial fat pad could absorb the vibratory energy and chest wall receptors fail to recognise it. One curious observation is, palpitation is described in a succinct manner by certain patients only. Since , it essentially involves higher cortical senses , we believe spatial intelligence of the patient may also be important. Why Irregularity in heart beat is well recognized? For the given heart rate , irregular rhythms are felt more often as palpitation than sinus tachycardia. This is the reason single ectopic beat is easily felt than sustained tachycardia. A common sequence of palpitation due to ectopic beat is , a suddenly missed beat, subsequent pause and forceful post ectopic beat.', 'A heart rate is the number of times the heart beats per minute.The heart rate changes throughout a person’s life, according to their age, their fitness, and even whether they are frightened. This article examines normal resting heart rates, target heart rates with exercise, and investigates an abnormal heart rate. Read now A-fib surgery: Types, risks, and what to expect Atrial fibrillation, or A-fib, is an irregular heartbeat that can cause complications if it is not treated. Treatment includes medication and lifestyle changes, such as healthful dietary choices and regular exercise. However, for some people, surgery may be needed. Find out more about what this involves. Read now Arrhythmia: Causes, symptoms, types, and treatment Arrhythmia is a term for an irregular heartbeat. A person may feel dizzy or breathless, or like their heart is racing or fluttering. Many arrhythmias are harmless, but a diagnosis is important because they can indicate severe damage. Here, learn more about the types of arrhythmias, as well as causes and treatments. Read now Chronic or persistent A-fib: What you need to know Atrial fibrillation is a condition in which the upper two chambers of the heart beat quickly and irregularly. Chronic atrial fibrillation can cause dizziness, heart palpitations, and fatigue. Symptoms do not always occur but can include sweating, dizziness, palpitations, chest pain, shortness of breath and anxiety.', 'Reply Jason says December 27, 2016 at 10:07 am Thanks for the information you’ve provided, it’s very interesting and I learned a thing or two. I’m a 44 year old male 5’9”, 165lbs, no family history of heart problems, and have been running regularly for about 8 years now. I have typically run (trail runs) 10-30 miles per week, and run several half marathons per year, however this past year I started training for marathon and 50k distances, so I’ve ramped up my training to about 50-55 miles per week. My resting heart rate is around 50-52 BPM. At night when I’m watching TV, I can feel my heart beating “irregular”, especially now that I’ve been running more mileage per week. A year ago, I thought that my irregular heart beat was due to the excessive amount of coffee I used to drink. I quit drinking coffee (cold turkey) in February 2016, and after I managed to make it through the withdrawls, my irregular heart beat seemed to get better, however now that I’m running more, I’m feeling the irregular beats again. Sometimes I get a little anxiety when I feel my heart beating like this, just because it doesn’t feel normal. Also, about a year and a half ago, I started having occasional problems getting full deep breaths when I’m at rest. When I’m running or biking I don’t have problems breathing once I’m warmed up and going. Could the slower heart beat be associated with the breathing? My doctor tested me for asthma, and ruled that out. After what I’ve been reading in your blog, I’m wondering if I should be seeing a cardiologist?']"

Atrial Flutter vs. Atrial Fibrillation Foods to Avoid With AFib Atrial flutter is a problem with way your heart beats. Such problems, whether in the rhythm or speed of the heartbeat, are known as arrhythmias. What Happens in Atrial Flutter? Your heartbeat is a sort of electrical circuit. Sometimes the signals that cause it go awry. Atrial flutter results from an abnormal circuit inside the right atrium, or upper chamber of your heart. It beats extra-fast, about 250-400 beats per minute. A normal heartbeat is 60-100 beats per minute. The beat slows down when the signals reach the AV node, a bundle of cells in the upper wall of muscle between the ventricles, your heart’s lower chambers. It usually slows the beats by a fourth or a half, or down to somewhere between 150 and 75 beats per minute.', ""Heart Matters magazine Medical Ask the experts Atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation Print Related Links What is atrial fibrillation?

I have been diagnosed with atrial flutter, although I only have it occasionally. I have never heard of this and can only find information on atrial fibrillation. What’s the difference? Senior Cardiac Nurse Christopher Allen says: Atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation are both abnormal heart rhythms . They occur when there is an issue with the electrical signals and pathways in your heart, which usually help it beat in an organised, effective way. Normally, the top chambers (atria) contract and push blood into the bottom chambers (ventricles). In atrial fibrillation, the atria beat irregularly. In atrial flutter, the atria beat regularly, but faster than usual and more often than the ventricles, so you may have four atrial beats to every one ventricular beat. Atrial flutter is less common than atrial fibrillation Atrial flutter is less common, but has similar symptoms (feeling faint, tiredness, palpitations, shortness of breath or dizziness). Some people have mild symptoms, others have none at all. About a third of people with atrial flutter also have atrial fibrillation. Both conditions carry increased risk of stroke , usually managed by drugs (such as warfarin or a newer anticoagulant ). This is why, whether you have atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, it is vital to be diagnosed early so you can get the right treatment and reduce your stroke risk.

Reply Travis Van Slooten Dec 31, 2017 Paul: Without seeing the ECG it’s impossible to say but it could just be a simple PAC (premature atrial contraction). Travis Reply David ( Years with AFIB: 2 ) Dec 31, 2017 Remember, if you have Bradycardia and can’t read an ECG the Kardia isn’t going to help much. I have Afib, and when not in Afib (most of the time), my heart rate is below 50. I can do a basic reading of the ECG and know that it’s steady and thus I’m not in Afib.', 'Inaccurate or misleading filter. The AliveCor app is able to indicate if you’re in afib or not because of a filter. This filter is based on an algorithm. Unfortunately, algorithms aren’t perfect. As a result, there are times where the filter will indicate “possible afib” when you’re not in afib at all. If you’re not in afib but your ECG isn’t normal either, the filter will indicate “Unclassified.” Both scenarios aren’t ideal as it can cause a lot of stress and anxiety for an afibber:) As a side note, the best way to get an accurate analysis is to take advantage of the ECG analysis service they provide or send the ECG to your doctor to be analyzed. Alternatively, you can take a few recordings back-to-back to see what your results are. If the first results says “Possible Afib” and the other two say normal or unclassified, you’re probably not in afib. Also, the more you use the monitor the more you’ll be able to decipher the ECG. You’ll be able to tell if the “Possible Afib” warning is legit or just an error. Expensive ECG analysis service (and Premium service). Up until recently, there were three ECG analysis options and the cheapest one was only $2. There are only two options now and the cheapest one is $9 and the other one is a whopping $19. I think the prices for these are way too high. I think $5 and $10 (or even $15) would be more reasonable.', 'Below are multiple full 12-lead ECG examples of atrial fibrillation: Atrial Fibrillation with Bradycardia ECG (Example 1) Atrial Fibrillation with Bradycardia ECG (Example 2) Atrial Fibrillation with Bradycardia ECG (Example 3) Atrial Fibrillation with Normal Ventricular Rate ECG (Example 1) Atrial Fibrillation with Normal Ventricular Rate ECG (Example 2) Atrial Fibrillation with Normal Ventricular Rate ECG (Example 3) Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Rate ECG (Example 1) Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Rate ECG (Example 2) Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Rate ECG (Example 3) Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Rate ECG (Example 4) Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Rate ECG (Example 5) On physical examination, the heart rhythm will be “irregularly irregular” and frequently tachycardic. Findings of heart failure may be present depending on the ventricular rate, duration of atrial fibrillation and other factors. There will never be an S4 heart sound present during atrial fibrillation, as this heart sound is produced when atrial contraction forces blood into a noncompliant left ventricle. Normal atrial contraction is lost during atrial fibrillation. The diagnosis of a left atrial appendage (LAA) thrombus , if suspected, must be done using transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) or cardiac CT — the latter less commonly used). It is important to note that transthoracic echocardiography does not detect left atrial appendage thrombi in the vast majority of patients. TEE findings of a left atrial appendage thrombus includes direct visualization of a mobile echodensity within the appendage. The echodensity should move independent of the walls of the atrium; this helps to distinguish artifact or trabeculae from thrombus. Pulse wave Doppler can be used in the left atrial appendage to determine the flow velocity; a velocity of less than 0.4 m/s indicates a higher risk for thromboembolism in general.', 'Atrial Tachycardia with 2:1 AV Block ECG (Example 2) AV Nodal Reentrant Tachycardia (AVNRT) ECG (Example 1) AV Nodal Reentrant Tachycardia (AVNRT) ECG (Example 2) AV Nodal Reentrant Tachycardia (AVNRT) ECG (Example 3) AV Reentrant Tachycardia (AVRT) ECG Ectopic Atrial Bradycardia ECG Junctional Bradycardia ECG (Example 1) Junctional Bradycardia ECG (Example 2) Junctional Tachycardia ECG Multifocal Atrial Tachycardia (MAT) ECG Non-conducted or Blocked Premature Atrial Contractions (PACs) ECG Premature Atrial Contractions (PACs) ECG Supraventricular Tachycardia with Aberrancy ECG Atrial Fibrillation Atrial Fibrillation Atrial Fibrillation with Bradycardia ECG (Example 1) Atrial Fibrillation with Bradycardia ECG (Example 2) Atrial Fibrillation with Bradycardia ECG (Example 3) Atrial Fibrillation with Normal Ventricular Rate ECG (Example 1) Atrial Fibrillation with Normal Ventricular Rate ECG (Example 2) Atrial Fibrillation with Normal Ventricular Rate ECG (Example 3) Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Rate ECG (Example 1) Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Rate ECG (Example 2) Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Rate ECG (Example 3) Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Rate ECG (Example 4) Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Rate ECG (Example 5) Atrial Flutter Atrial Flutter Atrial Flutter with Variable Conduction ECG (Example 1) Atrial Flutter with Variable Conduction ECG (Example 2) Atrial Flutter with Variable Conduction ECG (Example 3) Atrial Flutter with 1:1 Conduction ECG Atrial Flutter with 2:1 Conduction ECG (Example 1) Atrial Flutter with 2:1 Conduction ECG (Example 2)']"

Agriculture is believed to be a pre-requisite for cities, which help preserve surplus production and create economies of scale. Cities reduced transport costs for goods, people, and ideas by bringing them all together in one spot. Key Terms Old World : The known world before the discovery of the Americas. Neolithic Revolution : The Neolithic Revolution or Neolithic Demographic Transition, sometimes called the Agricultural Revolution, was the world’s first historically verifiable revolution in agriculture. urbanism : the study of cities, their geographic, economic, political, social, and cultural environment Early cities developed in a number of regions, from Mesopotamia to Asia to the Americas. The very first cities were founded in Mesopotamia after the Neolithic Revolution, around 7500 BCE. Mesopotamian cities included Eridu, Uruk, and Ur. Early cities also arose in the Indus Valley and ancient China. Among the early Old World cities, one of the largest was Mohenjo-daro, located in the Indus Valley (present-day Pakistan); it existed from about 2600 BCE, and had a population of 50,000 or more. In the ancient Americas, the earliest cities were built in the Andes and Mesoamerica, and flourished between the 30 th century BCE and the 18 th century BCE.']"

Madison , though the defendant, James Madison, refused to appear. [76] On February 24, the Supreme Court announced its decision, which biographer Joel Richard Paul describes as ""the single most significant constitutional decision issued by any court in American history."" The Court held that Madison was legally bound to deliver Marbury\'s commission, and that Marbury had the right to sue Madison. Yet the Court also held that it could not order Madison to deliver the commission because the Judiciary Act of 1789 had unconstitutionally expanded the Court\'s original jurisdiction to include writs of mandamus , a type of court order that commands a government official to perform an act they are legally required to perform. Because that portion of the Judiciary Act of 1789 was unconstitutional, the Court held that it did not have original jurisdiction over the case even while simultaneously holding that Madison had violated the law. [77] Marbury v. Madison was the first case in which the Supreme Court struck down a federal law as unconstitutional and it is most significant for its role in establishing the Supreme Court\'s power of judicial review , or the power to invalidate laws as unconstitutional. As Marshall put it, ""it is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is."" [78] By asserting the power of judicial review in a holding that did not require the Jefferson administration to take action, the Court upheld its own powers without coming into direct conflict with a hostile executive branch that likely would not have complied with a court order. [79] Historians mostly agree that the framers of the Constitution did plan for the Supreme Court to have some sort of judicial review, but Marshall made their goals operational. [80] Though many Democratic-Republicans expected a constitutional crisis to arise after the Supreme Court asserted its power of judicial review, the Court upheld the repeal of the Midnight Judges Act in the 1803 case of Stuart v.

Madison (1803) established the principle of judicial review — the power of the federal courts to declare legislative and executive acts unconstitutional. The unanimous opinion was written by Chief Justice John Marshall. President John Adams named William Marbury as one of forty-two justices of the peace on March 2, 1801. The Senate confirmed the nominations the following day, March 3, which was Adams\'s last full day in office. However, acting Secretary of State John Marshall failed to deliver four of the commissions, including Marbury’s. When Thomas Jefferson took office on March 4, he ordered that the four remaining commissions be withheld. Marbury sued the new secretary of state, James Madison, in order to obtain his commission.

In a former schoolhouse on a side street in downtown Topeka, you can walk through a history of events that led up to that landmark decision, and what has happened since. The building, now a National Historic Site, once served as Monroe Elementary, and it still has a schoolhouse feel; in the hallway you pass drinking fountains set low enough for a kindergartner to reach; there’s the smell of chalk, and echoes in the hall. Monroe Elementary was one of four all-black elementary schools in Topeka when it was selected by NAACP strategists in 1950 as part of a larger plan to bring the “separate but equal” doctrine into the courts. With NAACP guidance thirteen sets of parents agreed to attempt to enroll their children in white schools, not expecting to be admitted, and then file complaints. Linda Brown (b 1942) was a third grader at Monroe at the time her parents Leola and Oliver Brown decided to participate; alphabetically “Brown” was the first name on the lawsuit; forever after Brown v Board of Education is the name associated with the end of public school segregation in the United States. The full story, however, is multi-layered and complex; the exhibits in the Brown v Board of Education National Historic Site take you through the key points, even going further back in time than the 1896 Supreme Court decision when Plessy v Ferguson put the “separate but equal” doctrine legally into place. Race and the American Creed is the place to start; it’s a movie in the auditorium. » read more', 'Lemon v Kurtzman was a 1971 case ruling that legislation primarily benefiting the Roman Catholic (private) schools represented an ""excessive entanglement"" of church and state. As part of this ruling, the Court also pointed out that some states had historically used the ploy of channeling public education money into private schools as a way to avoid the desegration mandated by Brown v Board of Education. Zelman v Simmon-Harris in 2002 found School Voucher programs to be constitutional. This made it possible for public school moneys to be diverted into private schools. The power of Lemon v Kurtzman was reduced by the ruling.

From this point on, it is possible that the further growth of the fatty acid chain occurs in a reverse manner to that which has been described for its breakdown. According to the best hypothesis, the latter process involves the successive splitting off of two carbon atom fragments (as acetic acid).52,68 The reverse of this process in fat formation would demand the successive appearance of fatty acids composed of four, six, eight, ten, twelve, fourteen, and sixteen carbon atoms. While this has not been demonstrated for adipose tissue, it is suggestive that all these stages of fat formation are found in an organ which is a very active fat-builder, namely, the lactating breast. 6\\) Carbohydrate and Protein Metabolism.-Earlier writers on metabolism have talked somewhat loosely of the formation of protein from carbohydrate. Strictly speaking, such a transformation is impossible for the amino groups which characterize the building stones of proteins must be derived from amino acids or proteins ingested as such. What can and does occur is the exchange of the amino group of an amino acid with the keto group of a keto acid derived from carbohydrate, a process known as transamination. 70 ,71 In this process, the carbon residue of the amino acid reverts to', 'The energy produced from the next metabolic process will be used for all kinds of activities such as thinking and breathing and speaking.

The word ‘carbohydrate’ is derived from the Greek word ‘sakcharon’ meaning ‘sugar’. Carbohydrates are nothing but aldehyde or ketone compounds with multiple hydroxyl groups. The literal meaning of carbohydrates is ‘carbon hydrates’ which originates from their chemical composition. The chemical composition of carbohydrates or saccharides is (CH2O)n where n>3 or n=3. Basic Functions Of The Carbohydrates Energy reserves: Carbohydrates make up energy stores, fuels and metabolic intermediates. Structural framework of genetic material: The sugars ribose and deoxyribose are a part of the structural framework of genetic material RNA and DNA.

Our goal with this blog post is to help you understand how supplements work with forage and to develop your knowledge of horse nutrition. As always, do contact us with your questions about anything to do with horses, supplements, feed, forage, and health. Understanding Horse Nutrition The basics of horse nutrition must include the following five core nutrients: Carbohydrates Carbohydrates should make up the largest portion of your horse’s diet. Horses need two types of carbohydrates – structural and nonstructural. Structural carbohydrates represent the fiber your horse consumes when eating hay and grass. Because of how the horse digestive system works, there is incredible nutritional value in feeding your horse grass and hay. Nonstructural carbohydrates are the sugars and starches are mostly found in grains and other feed concentrates. Because the horse’s digestive system is designed to digest a high-roughage diet, you must not feed your horse too many nonstructural carbohydrates. It’s important you work with an expert in horse nutrition to understand how to feed your horse nonstructural carbohydrates. Remember that your horse should be “fed a minimum of 1% of its body weight in forage (or a dry matter basis); the ideal is 1.5 to 2% of its body weight. Feeding less roughage than this can lead to health issues such as colic and ulcers.” (University of Georgia Extension)']"

You hear the term carbohydrate all the time, but where did the term carbohydrate come from? In organic chemistry there are groups of certain atoms referred to as functional groups. These functional groups are usually attached to at least one carbon atom and help give a molecule it’s name. For example, -PO43- is called a phosphate. Hence the name of H12N3O4P, a common ingredient in fertilizer, is named ammonium phosphate. What does all this have to do with carbohydrates? A common base formula for simple sugars is CH2O. Therefore early scientists simple called sugars carbohydrates due to the H2O attached to the carbon atom. Sciency stuff: Are sugars just hydrates of carbon? No. In order for a compound to be classified as a sugar, or carbohydrate, it must have at least two hydroxyl (-OH) groups and either an aldehyde or a ketone group. The sugars with an aldehyde group are called aldose and the sugars with a ketone group are called ketose. Alternative Keywords: Where did carbohydrates get their name?

But do we really know what is carbohydrates and how they should be included in a balanced diet chart? Well, carbohydrates belong to a class of biomolecules that plays important roles in the body, such as the transport of energy, healthy functioning of the immune system, fertilization and blood clotting. Carbohydrates or saccharides function as food storage molecules long term, as the structural support for cells and its protective membrane. Foods that are high in starch, such as beans, potatoes, rice, cereals and bran are a rich source of carbohydrates. Types of carbohydrates There are mainly three types of carbohydrates in food. These carbohydrates are required by the body to produce glucose that works as a fuel and provides energy to maintain the proper functioning of the body.

There are numerous biosynthetic pathways to both break down and synthesize lipids in the body. The main biological functions of lipids include storing energy, as lipids may be broken down to yield large amounts of energy. Lipids also form the structural components of cell membranes, and form various messengers and signaling molecules within the body.

The fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) are isoprene-based lipids that are stored in the liver and fat. Some types of lipids must be obtained from the diet, while others can be synthesized within the body. The types of lipids found in food include plant and animal triglycerides, sterols, and membrane phospholipids (e.g., cholesterol).

Firmly established major risk factors for CIN include active smoking and human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. A 2006 case-control study of Taiwanese women established SHS as a major risk factor for CIN in addition to active smoking and HPV. The authors presented an indirect and a direct potential mechanism for the development of CIN following SHS exposure. CIN could be caused indirectly by immune suppression or directly by a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-DNA adduct [69]. More recent studies continue to suggest an association between SHS and CIN, and while these studies continue to be conducted, few have provided conclusive results [468,469]. NONALCOHOLIC FATTY LIVER DISEASE Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is one of the most common liver diseases in the United States. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease covers a broad range of diseases from steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and can have dramatically varied underlying pathology. NASH is a significant clinical concern due to potential disease progression resulting in cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease [351]. Yuan et al. employed a mouse model transgenic for human apoB100 to consider the effect of passive smoke on cholesterol and triglyceride levels. They found no significant change in cholesterol levels with passive smoke exposure but a marked increase in triglycerides in the liver. The increased lipid accretion in hepatocytes is consistent with lipid changes seen in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [63].', 'Earning virtually any important adjust is overwhelming, and adjusting from common or snug picks to extra advantageous low carb foods is unquestionably a major transform.

But this argument can be twisted against its own author: those crimes are not called privileged because the princes reserved such crimes to themselves when they conceded the privilege of exemption to the clergymen, as Barclay thinks, but are called privileged because by privilege of the Apostolic See the kings of France are permitted to investigate those crimes, which Clarus explains in question 36, last section, “Quaero,” and in his commentary on the canon “Ut clericorum,” Clementinae, title “De officio iudicis ordinarii.”240 To the last proposition, which Barclay gathers from what has been said before, that is, that there can be no exemption of clergymen from the authority of the prince, I reply that this proposition is incorrectly gathered from what has been said, both because it has been demonstrated that supreme princes were able to and wanted to exempt clergymen from their own authority, and because even if they had not wanted it, or had not been able to do it, the Supreme Pontiff was able to do it and wanted to exempt them, or declare them exempt by divine law, and the princes, even supreme ones, cannot impede this exemption. And this is the common judgment of the scholars, both theologians and canonists, which until now nobody but heretics opposed. And certainly this is what they Edition: current; Page: [376] who want the exemption to be of divine law think, and not even Barclay doubts it, and Navarrus expressly teaches it in chapter “Novit,” notation 6, n. 30. But this is what they who think that the exemption is not of divine law also say and teach, as is clear from Francisco de Vitoria, relectio “De potestate Ecclesiae,” question 6, proposition 5; from Domingo de Soto, in his commentary on book 4 of Lombard’s Sententiae, distinction 25, question 2, article 2; from Martin Ledesma in his commentary on the same book 4, part 2, question 20, article 3; from Domingo Bañez in his commentary on 2a 2ae, question 67, article 1; and from Diego Covarrubias, Practicae quaestiones, chapter 31, conclusions 3 and 4, whose words, like those of Soto, we have adduced in the previous chapter. Hence the question of whether the prince is allowed to revoke the privilege of the exemption of the clergy, which Barclay in the last chapter left unanswered, is settled, as the alleged scholars respond that it is not in any way allowed.', 'Securities Exempt from SEC Registration Some securities offerings are exempted from the registration requirement of the act. These include: Intrastate offerings Offerings of limited size Securities issued by municipal, state, and federal governments Private offerings to a limited number of persons or institutions The other main goal of the Securities Act of 1933 was to prohibit deceit and misrepresentations. The act aimed to eliminate fraud that happens during the sales of securities. President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Securities Act of 1933 into law as part of his famous New Deal. History of the Securities Act of 1933 The Securities Act of 1933 was the first federal legislation used to regulate the stock market. The act took power away from the states and put it into the hands of the federal government. The act also created a uniform set of rules to protect investors against fraud. It was signed into law by President Franklin D. Roosevelt and is considered part of the New Deal passed by Roosevelt. The Securities Act of 1933 is governed by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which was created a year later by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Several amendments to the Securities Act of 1933 have passed since its creation. Amendments have been passed to update rules numerous times over the years, with the latest enacted in 2018.']"

As such, it is worthwhile to point out how (and why) statism and capitalism affect society as a whole outwith the narrow bounds of politics and economics.', ""From application to graduation and beyond: Explori...

Insight: The ARSC Blog What Is the LASIK Success Rate? Posted October 23, 2017 LASIK The LASIK success rate – or LASIK outcomes – is well understood with literally thousands of clinical studies looking at visual acuity and patient satisfaction. The latest research reports 99 percent of patients achieve better than 20/40 vision and more than 90 percent achieve 20/20 or better. In addition, LASIK has an unprecedented 96 percent patient satisfaction rate – the highest of any elective procedure. ( Journal of Cataract & Refractive Surgery , Vol. 42, Issue 8, August 2016, Pages 1224-1234). For those considering a vision correction procedure, understanding the LASIK success rate is an important as part of your research as well as understanding what these rates mean for your own vision goals. Understanding the LASIK Success Rate One of the most common questions eye surgeons are asked is: What is the LASIK success rate? To help answer the question let’s break down the definition of LASIK outcomes. LASIK outcomes are measured by a variety of factors, including visual acuity – the sharpness of your vision – and overall patient satisfaction. Visual Acuity is the sharpness of your vision. It’s a static measurement usually taken in a doctor’s office while you are sitting still. Most consider 20/20 (the ability to read the eye chart at 20 feet) to be “normal.” However, the measurement of visual acuity – or 20/20 vision – may not completely define quality of vision for everyone. Some people further define quality of vision by degrees of clarity, contrast sensitivity, reaction time and other factors. Researchers have looked into LASIK patient satisfaction including how happy patients are with their vision to how has it impacted quality of life. When talking about the LASIK success rate, it’s also important to understand potential risks and complications . When talking about the LASIK success rate, there is only one measurement that matters: Does it give you what you want? Does it help you achieve your own vision goals? Is your lifestyle or your career enhanced? The One Measurement that Matters Studies about patient satisfaction after surgery show that one of the most important factors is whether the surgery meets the patient’s expectations. To figure out your LASIK success rate, ask yourself what you expect to get out of laser vision correction surgery. Why are you thinking about LASIK? How do you think LASIK will make your life better? A good place to start is to write down your expectations. This is extremely valuable both for you and your surgeon in mapping out a recommended course of action. A lot of people have heard good things about LASIK and expect that it will improve their lives. But they don’t always take a long, detailed look at what that means – what LASIK will help them do, or do better, or enjoy more. Setting personal vision goals helps the person define their LASIK success. It also helps the surgeon understand why the person wants LASIK – and how to guide them through their LASIK experience and set appropriate expectations. Why Do You Want LASIK? Reasons for wanting good or even excellent vision are as different as the people who are thinking about LASIK. For anyone with vision problems, there are a million reasons to consider LASIK. The good reasons – the reasons that leads to LASIK satisfaction and LASIK success – are the ones that matter to you, because you want to change the way you see in life. For you, LASIK success might lead to getting glasses out of the way of your daily life. Or having great vision at the ready 24/7 might be important for your current job, or your dream job. OK, then – what are some of the reasons people turn to LASIK? What are they looking for in LASIK success? One thing you think of when you think of success is your career. Not surprisingly, people turn to LASIK to do better at their jobs – or to get their dream jobs. For example – are you a police officer, firefighter, EMT or other first responder ? If so, you need great eyesight. But you also have to work in conditions where it’s tough, and sometimes impossible, to wear glasses or contact. Imagine pursuing someone through thick underbrush, and getting slapped in the face repeatedly by branches. There’s a good chance you’ll lose your glasses or have your contacts damaged. Either would put you at risk. Or think of what a firefighter routinely has to deal with – smoke, water, and steam. For you, LASIK success might mean being able to do your job in tough conditions – like fires or arrests – without your eyeglasses or contact lenses getting in the way. Are you in the military? Your LASIK success might be similar – the ability to serve in harsh desert or jungle or arctic conditions where eyeglasses or contacts would be a major problem. But even for members of the military who aren’t in combat assignments, LASIK can make an enormous difference. If you’re a maintainer, your work environment is filled with oil, grease, dirt, and grime, any and all of which can be a no-go with conventional eyewear. Or perhaps you do close-in technical work where precise vision matters. Whatever your role and branch of service, your LASIK success means that you’re better able to serve. For pilots – in military combat and support roles, in the airlines and in general aviation – having the best eyesight possible can be a matter of life and death. In fact, the Navy and Air Force were among the earliest adopters of LASIK, to make sure the pilots with the best overall qualifications weren’t ruled out because of vision problems. Your LASIK success as a pilot is measured by your ability to do your job or realize your passion for flight. People in many careers depend on LASIK. Professional athletes turn to LASIK because they need a special kind of precise vision – for example, the ability to see depth and contrast, so they can see and react to the motion of a ball seen against a crowd, or read its spin or know where it’s going. And playing a sport means you need to deal with tough conditions, too – dirt, dust, wind, glare and sweat. That’s not an easy environment for eyeglasses or contacts. Which might explain why so many athletes , like Tampa Bay Rays catcher Wilson Ramos, Houston Rockets point guard Chris Paul and Atlanta Falcons linebacker De’Vondre Campbell, have relied on LASIK to protect or jump-start their performance and sharply improve or extend their careers. They also find that recovery time is short, so they can be back in action fast. An athlete’s LASIK success rate? It’s measured in batting average, completed passes, tackles and three-pointers. People in many other careers turn to LASIK – photographers, artists, engineers, and scientists who need the sharpest possible vision to do their work. There are hundreds of thousands of people who can say that their LASIK success rate is their ability to do great work, to work at what they love, or to work at all. LASIK success might mean playing a sport, flying a plane, chasing your toddler, or looking your best People turn to LASIK not just for work but also for play, and to follow their passions. Your LASIK success might be measured not by your job but by how much you’re enjoying your lifestyle and your life. The same factors that make LASIK great for athletes and first responders can make a difference for people who play sports or love the outdoors. You don’t need to be a professional athlete – you might love playing in your softball league, or catching a frisbee in the park, or going hiking or camping. The conditions are just as challenging as they are for a pro – and the convenience of LASIK can transform your experience. The same goes if you swim or surf or sail – sand, spray and harsh sunlight don’t mix well with glasses or contact lenses, but they’re no trouble at all once you’ve had LASIK. And if you’re a skier who has to deal with snow spray and glare – the temperature may be different than for boaters and beach lovers, but the freedom you get from LASIK is just the same. We talked about how LASIK benefits professional pilots. But not all pilots are professionals – thousands of people own or rent airplanes and fly for the pure joy of flight. They can benefit from LASIK just as professionals can. The same goes for photographers. For every pro who makes a living from photography, there are hundreds of thousands of people who take photographs simply because they love to. If you’re one of those people, you can sharpen your vision, make it easier to use your cameras, and produce better results, all thanks to LASIK. What if you don’t pursue an active lifestyle? There’s still plenty that LASIK can do for you. Some people think of eyeglasses as a fashion accessory – but many people don’t. Thanks to LASIK, you can throw away your glasses and show your best face. People also turn to LASIK when they’re on the threshold of major life events – graduating from college, getting married, starting families (ever tried to run after your small kids while keeping your glasses in place?) or setting out on new adventures after they retire. LASIK can liberate you from your glasses or contacts and set you on the path to your next phase of life. And of course, LASIK success doesn’t have to involve any activity at all. Many people measure LASIK success rates just by the pure pleasure of having the best possible vision, and the freedom to do without contacts – or to never again be forced to grope on the nightstand to find their glasses in the middle of the night. No matter what you love to do in life, there may well be a LASIK success story waiting for you. Talk to a surgeon, define your LASIK vision, and start on the path to LASIK success So how should you start to build your own LASIK success story? The questions you really need to ask yourself are” “How do you see yourself benefitting from LASIK??” What you hope to get out of LASIK? Why does great eyesight matter to you? And how are your glasses or contacts getting in your way? How do they keep you from living life the way you want? The next step is to sit down with a LASIK surgeon. It’s only by talking with a surgeon that you can find out whether you’re a good candidate for LASIK and ask your questions about the LASIK success rate. The surgeon can help you understand what to expect from the procedure, what the experience will be like during and after surgery, and how your life and your lifestyle will change. There are resources here to help you find a qualified surgeon in your area, and suggestions for questions you can ask to make sure you find out what you need to know. Do your research, get informed, and work carefully to set your vision goals. You’ll soon be well on the way to LASIK success.

London, for instance, seems to think that merely painting its cycle paths ""copenhagen blue"" will lead to success. It won\'t. To get a really high rate of cycling you need the proper infrastructure. There is one country in the world which has it. So what\'s to be done ? These are figures for all journeys, not just commuters Groningenize ! What is needed everywhere is to build better infrastructure and make cycling more attractive. Copenhagen itself could do with a good dose of ""Groningenization"" in order to improve both its cycling rate and the demographics of its cyclists. Groningen itself needs to continue to improve its infrastructure in order to continue to increase its cycling rate. And the rest of the world would be best off watching the best example. To ""Copenhagenize"" is to copy what is second best. ""Groningenize"", ""Netherlandsize"", even ""Amsterdamize"". Conclusion Copenhagen has achieved a lot. It has the highest cycling rate in Europe outside of the Netherlands. There is quite a lot of catching up to do to get to the point that many Dutch cities have reached, but they\'re still doing really well by world standards. Let\'s keep it in perspective, cheer on their success so far. However, it\'s also important to realise why their success has been limited, and try to understand why Dutch cities have achieved so much more.']"

Follow Us Close ingredient vegan vegetarian Skills Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Tofu by Emily Han Updated : Yesterday Credit: Ghazalle Badiozamani; Food Styling: Jesse Szewczyk Okay, chances are you know what tofu is . It’s that white stuff that you often find in stir-fries, or that vegetarians put on sandwiches . But there’s a lot more to it than that. Tofu has been around for a while. It may be the original meat substitute. And it’s incredibly versatile — there are all kinds of tofu out there, and it can be used in all sorts of ways. If you haven’t really cared for tofu in the past, chances are that you just didn’t find the kind for you! So if you’re looking to cut back on your meat intake, and want to make sure you’re getting protein, here’s everything you need to know about one of the most popular meat substitutes. What is Tofu? Tofu is an ancient food that turns soybeans into a convenient, easy-to-digest meat alternative. The familiar white block of tofu is beloved in its countries of origin, but has been making inroads in the American lifestyle since the 70’s. To make tofu, whole soybeans are cooked in water, then ground up and strained. This makes soymilk. Tofu is then made by “coagulating” the solids back out of the milk, much like a fresh cheese is made from milk. There are a few methods for making tofu, each originating in a different place and creating a different result. To make Chinese-style, “cotton” tofu, the soymilk is coagulated with Nigari — made from the minerals left over after sea water has been evaporated. Other coagulants, like gypsum, Epsom salts, and even vinegar or lemon juice are also used. Many manufacturers create their own distinctive products by formulating their own combination of coagulants for their recipe. Curds of tofu form and are scooped into a square mold, leaving behind much of the water from the milk. To make Japanese-style silken tofu, a coagulant is added that thickens the milk like a firm pudding, instead of separating the tofu from the water. Chinese style, cotton tofu has a spongy, porous texture, and comes in several levels of firmness, from soft to extra firm, depending on how much water has been pressed out of the block. Tofu-making has spread to all corners of the world, as more people discover the benefits of cooking and eating this enigmatic white cube-like food. Tofu is a versatile and inexpensive source of protein. Four ounces firm tofu has nine grams protein and only 80 calories. Where did tofu originate? The earliest record of a form of tofu (called Doufu) is in 950 AD China. Like many ancient foods, tofu-making goes back beyond written history. There are several theories about its origins, a long-held one is that it was a lucky discovery when soymilk was mixed with sea water, and the mineral salts caused the proteins to coagulate and form curds. Some scholars suggest another theory, that the method of curdling soy milk was inspired by the process used by nomads to make dairy cheese from milk. What’s the difference between tofu and other meat alternatives? Tofu has long been described as “the meat with no bone,” not because it resembles meat but because of its high protein content. Tofu is often used to make meat alternatives, like hot dogs or a ground-beef substitute, but that requires some manipulation of the tofu by the cook. Because tofu is made from strained soymilk, it has no fiber and has a relatively smooth texture. And because tofu has been around for so long, it has a long history of recipes and dishes specifically for it — something that more recently developed meat alternatives lack. What does tofu taste like? Tofu is mild, slightly beany, with a consistency ranging from custard to a semi-firm cheese. However, each type of tofu has subtle nuances of flavor. The coagulant makes a difference, and nigari tofu has a hint of bitterness, while tofu coagulated with calcium sulfate tastes sweeter. While Westerners often think of tofu as bland, people who grow up eating tofu often appreciate the slight sweetness, the hint of flavor from the coagulant, and the texture of their favorite freshly made tofu. Where can I find tofu? Most US grocery stores carry at least one kind of tofu in a refrigerated case, often near the dairy products, or in the produce section by the Asian vegetables. Boxes of silken tofu floating in a small amount of water can be found on the shelf in the Asian foods section. Additionally a drier form of firm, pre-marinated baked tofu is also widely sold in US grocery stores. Visit an Asian market, and the options are much wider. You’ll find pressed and baked slices of tofu, seasoned or unseasoned, pre-fried cubes and slabs of tofu, tofu noodles, tofu “skin” or sheets, and more. Small jars of fermented tofu are also available, usually in red or white varieties, which are intensely flavored and usually used more as a condiment. You can even make fermented tofu at home . Credit: Ghazalle Badiozamani; Food Styling: Jesse Szewczyk How do you prepare tofu? You can approach tofu in two ways. The first is to honor the long tradition of tofu cookery and explore Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, and other cuisines that have been preparing tofu for centuries. Try Japanese miso soup with silken tofu, fried Agedashi tofu with grated ginger and dipping sauce, or Teriyaki tofu. Chinese favorites like ma po tofu , stir fried tofu dishes of infinite variety, and hot and sour soup always work. Vietnamese, Thai, Indonesian, and other Asian cuisines offer distinctive and tasty specialties, and you can’t miss with old-school tofu dishes. The second way to approach tofu is to use it as a malleable, blank canvas. Tofu can be puréed and formed into hot dogs, transformed into “cheesecake,” or seasoned for a salad dressing. Crumbled firm tofu can transform into taco “meat,” or used as a breakfast scramble. Or it can be simmered in spaghetti sauce. Marinate and bake it, and you can slap it in a sandwich or put it on pizza. You can even cube or slice extra firm tofu and put it on the grill, for a smoky flavor. Crumble it and make burgers or “meatballs” from it, or season it with vinaigrette for a salad topping or sandwich filling.

And it has a sponge-like ability to soak up marinades. Firm and extra-firm tofu have the best results with marinating, since they can be relied on to keep their shape. Press and drain the tofu, then soak in any marinade for at least 30 minutes before cooking. Marinate your tofu: My Secret to Absolutely Delicious Tofu Note: Consider freezing tofu before marinating. Not only can you freeze tofu, but you also should freeze it any time you’re using a marinade. Freezing leaves tofu with a chewier texture and really ups its ability to absorb marinades. Here’s how: Yes, It’s OK to Freeze Tofu (and It Actually Has One Big Benefit!) How To Make Crispy Tofu Without Deep-Frying (Image credit: Joe Lingeman ) Step 3: Cook tofu in the oven, on the stove, or on the grill. Just as there are an infinite number of ways to flavor tofu, the same goes for cooking. The most common methods for cooking extra-firm and firm tofu are pan-frying, stir-frying, baking, grilling, and scrambling it. 1. Crispy Tofu (Without Deep Frying) Pan-frying is the easiest, least fussy way to cook up a batch of ultra-crispy cubes of tofu. After pressing and draining as much liquid from the block as possible, cut the tofu into cubes, sticks, or wedges, then toss it with cornstarch until all the pieces are well-coated. This extra layer is the ticket for maximum crispiness. Pan-fried tofu isn’t as good when made too far in advance, so plan to serve it shortly after it comes off the stove.

Stir-Fried Tofu As with any stir-fry, you can expect stir-fried tofu to come together in just a couple of minutes with minimal time at the stove. The tofu comes out of the wok with super-crisp, golden edges and a soft, chewy center. For the best results, start with extra-firm or firm tofu, and press out as much water as possible before cooking. Get a Recipe']"

A few minutes before it’s done, get out a container with a tight-fitting lid that’s big enough to fit the slices of tofu side by side. Add in the tamari, mirin, rice vinegar, sriracha, lime juice, ginger and lemongrass and stir until the sriracha is fully dissolved. Taste it, and add more sriracha. (Don’t worry–you can add a whole lot and your tofu still won’t be spicy.) When the tofu is ready, put it in the marinade, cover it up, and set aside for half an hour. If the tofu isn’t fully submerged, flip it halfway through. Meanwhile, wash and chop up all your veggies. Be sure to mince the Thai chiles very finely because they pack some punch! This is also a good time to get your rice started, since it will take a good half hour (more if you’re using wild rice) to cook. If you happen to have two good skillets (and two good burners), you can fry the tofu and stir fry the vegetables at the same time. The vegetables don’t take a whole lot of attention, and the tofu isn’t hard to fry. But if you want to do them one at a time like I did, start with the tofu. I followed Alton Brown’s instructions pretty much exactly, right down to the spring-loaded metal tongs. The only change I made was to use grapeseed oil instead of canola oil. This is not strictly necessary, but if you do use canola oil, keep a closer eye on the temperature. Grapeseed oil is good to 420 degrees. Canola oil varies significantly depending on how it’s processed, but the kind I have is only good to 375-400 degrees. And I have made it smoke before. Grapeseed oil seemed safer. When your tofu is done, remove it to a wire rack over a sheet pan to drain off any excess oil.', 'Omelette with Spicy Soy Sauce Chicken & Mushroom with Creamy Soy Sauce Japanese Bolognese with Aubergine and Courgette Savoy Rolls with Tomato and Gingerbread Sauce Red Cabbage Rolls with Dijon Mustard Sauce Festive Risotto with Mushrooms and Fresh Parmesan Chips Spring Cabbage Tart with Soy Sauce & Mustard Topping and Marinated Orange Salmon Japanese-style Fried Noodles Braised Chicken Wings and Vegetables Braised Carp in Garlic Soy Sauce Cube Salad with Prawn & Cheese Rolls Sea Food with Citrus Soy Sauce Jelly Mussels with Coconut Curry Soy Sauce Spaghetti Salad Salmon Tatare Fried Calamari with Sweet Soy Sauce Crispy Chicken Drumsticks with Spring Onion Sauce King Prawns in Spicy Soy Sauce Mushroom Soup Teriyaki-style Breast of Duck à la Orange Sautéed Fillet of Beef with Red Wine Soy Sauce Fillet of Pork with Garlic & Mayonnaise Leek and Orange & Carrot Soy Sauce Soy sauce & yoghurt marinade Soy sauce & beer marinade Soy sauce & thyme marinade Soy sauce & honey marinade Mediterranean soy sauce marinade Lemon & soy sauce marinade Ginger & soy sauce marinade Butaniku no Shogayaki – Pork in Ginger Soy Sauce Hotategai Shichimi-Shoyu yaki – Grilled Scallops with Shichimi or Chili Soy Sauce Yakiniku – Yakiniku-Style Entrecote Karei no Kara age Yasai ankake - Fried Plaice with Mixed Vegetables Kara age – Chicken Marinated in Soy Sauce', ""Tofu with Mushrooms | VegWeb.com, The World's Largest Collection of Vegetarian Recipes Skip to main content Home Recipes Community Vegan101 Blogs VegWeb The World's Largest Collection of Vegetarian Recipes Enter your keywords Surprise Me!

Nutritionist Jo Lewin offers up recipes, research and the key nutritional highlights of this soya product… An introduction to tofu Tofu, or bean curd, is a popular food derived from soya. It is made by curdling fresh soya milk, pressing it into a solid block and then cooling it – in much the same way that traditional dairy cheese is made by curdling and solidifying milk. The liquid (whey) is discarded, and the curds are pressed to form a cohesive bond. A staple ingredient in Thai and Chinese cookery, it can be cooked in different ways to change its texture from smooth and soft to crisp and crunchy. The origins of tofu Like many soya foods, tofu originated in China. Legend has it that it was discovered about 2000 years ago by a Chinese cook who accidentally curdled soy milk when he added nigari seaweed. Introduced into Japan in the eighth century, tofu was originally called 'okabe ' . Its modern name did not come into use until 1400. By the 1960s, interest in healthy eating brought tofu to Western nations. Since that time, countless research has demonstrated the many benefits that soya and tofu can provide . Nutritional highlights Tofu is a good source of protein and contains all nine essential amino acids. It is also a valuable plant source of iron and calcium and the minerals manganese and phosphorous. In addition to this, it also contains magnesium, copper, zinc and vitamin B1. An excellent food from a nutritional and health perspective , tofu is thought to provide many of the same benefits as soya beans. A 100g serving contains: 73 kcal 4.2g fat 0.5g sat fat 0.7g carbohydrate 8.1g protein Research Soya protein (from which tofu is derived) is believed to help lower levels of bad cholesterol (LDL) . Tofu contains phytoestrogens called isoflavones – a group of chemicals found in plant foods. They have a similar structure to the female hormone oestrogen and therefore mimic the action of oestrogen produced by the body. They naturally bind to oestrogen receptor sites in human cells including breast cells – potentially reducing the risk of breast cancer . Due to the phytoestrogen content of soya, many women decide to include soya-rich foods like tofu in their diet as they enter the menopause . During the menopause, the body’s natural production of oestrogen significantly reduces, and symptoms may arise. As phytoestrogens act as a weak oestrogen, they may help relieve symptoms by boosting levels slightly, reducing hot flushes in some women. Genetics, your gut microbiota and environmental factors play a huge part in how our bodies react to certain foods, so, as yet, we can’t say whether a diet rich in phytoestrogenic foods is beneficial or not. If you are a vegetarian or vegan , soya-based foods like tofu can be an invaluable part of your diet. How to select & store Tofu can be acquired in bulk or individual packages, both of which are refrigerated. It's sold in sealed containers kept at room temperature, which do not need refrigeration until they are opened. When opened, all tofus needs to be rinsed, covered with water and kept in a refrigerated container. To keep the tofu fresh for up to one week, the water should be changed often. If kept in the original package, you can freeze it for up to five months. Given its neutral taste and range of consistency, tofu has an amazing ability to work with almost all types of flavours and foods. Extra firm tofus are best for baking, grilling and stir-fries, while soft tofu is suitable for sauces, desserts, shakes and salad dressings. Of course, it is up to you to experiment! Try slicing, marinating and grilling it, or chopping it up into smallish pieces and frying it with garlic until golden. Silken tofu is a creamy, softer product. Safety Tofu and all soya products contain large amounts of oxalate. Individuals with a history of kidney stones containing oxalate should avoid over consuming soya products. Before changing your diet, it is advisable that you speak to your GP or an alternative health professional. Recipe suggestions Firm tofu makes a great addition to a stir-fry: Tofu, greens & cashew stir-fry Sesame noodles with tofu Experiment with tofu in some classic recipes: Tofu & spinach cannelloni Spicy tofu kedgeree Veggie Thai red curry Or something a little more unusual: Tofu & vegetable patties Devilled tofu kebabs Tofu is also a great addition to salads: Soba noodle & edamame salad with grilled tofu Summer vegetable bowl This page was last reviewed on 4th November 2019 by Kerry Torrens.

As the first third-generation interactive Chinese search engine launched by Sohu, www.sogou.com is described as vital to the company\'s future business prospects and development. According to the release, Sogou\'s launch requires a data center platform that can support storage of 10 billion Web pages; a Web page update and rating system; high-performance, concurrent access to and from numerous server clusters; and flexible expansion in years ahead. A traditional data center architecture could not meet these requirements; as such, Sohu says it decided to utilize the H3C next-generation data center architecture for its new Internet data center (IDC) equipment room. For Sohu, choosing the best networking equipment vendor was paramount, so the company collected equipment from several global networking solutions providers for a two-month field test. The H3C next-generation data center solution incorporated its S12508 core switch deployed in the data center working in tandem with its S7500E high-end multi-service routing switches, S5800 10-gigabit switches and its Web-based Intelligent Management Center (IMC) platform. This bundled solution provides line-speed transmission of small packets, a large buffer to deal with traffic surges resulting from user searches and reloads, and high-performance stacking for flexible short- and long-term network expansion.

This chapter describes the hardware and design recommendations for each of these layers in greater detail. The following major topics are included:', 'Data center network architectures - Wikipedia CentralNotice Data center network architectures From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Data center is a pool of resources (computational, storage, network) interconnected using a communication network . [1] [2] Data Center Network (DCN) holds a pivotal role in a data center , as it interconnects all of the data center resources together. DCNs need to be scalable and efficient to connect tens or even hundreds of thousands of servers to handle the growing demands of Cloud computing . [3] [4] Today’s data centers are constrained by the interconnection network. [5] Contents 1 Types of Data center network 1.1 Three-tier DCN 1.2 Fat tree DCN 1.3 DCell 1.4 Others 2 Challenges 3 Performance Analysis of DCNs 4 Structural robustness and Connectivity of DCNs 5 Energy efficiency of DCNs 6 References Types of Data center network [ edit ] Three-tier DCN [ edit ] The legacy three-tier DCN architecture follows a multi-rooted tree based network topology composed of three layers of network switches, namely access, aggregate, and core layers. [6] The servers in the lowest layers are connected directly to one of the edge layer switches. The aggregate layer switches interconnect together multiple access layer switches. All of the aggregate layer switches are connected to each other by core layer switches. Core layer switches are also responsible for connecting the data center to the Internet . The three-tier is the common network architecture used in data centers. [6] However, three-tier architecture is unable to handle the growing demand of cloud computing. [7] The higher layers of the three-tier DCN are highly oversubscribed. [3] Moreover, scalability is another major issue in three-tier DCN. Major problems faced by the three-tier architecture include, scalability, fault tolerance, energy efficiency, and cross-sectional bandwidth. The three-tier architecture uses enterprise-level network devices at the higher layers of topology that are very expensive and power hungry.

There has been no lack of work on this topic so the fact that there are theories which span several hundreds of years is not the result of lack of effort, rather an indication of the difficulty of the topic. The usual way to date such texts would be to examine which authors are referred to and which authors refer to the work. One can use this technique and see who Panini mentions. There are ten scholars mentioned by Panini and we must assume from the context that these ten have all contributed to the study of Sanskrit grammar. This in itself, of course, indicates that Panini was not a solitary genius but, like Newton , had ""stood on the shoulders of giants"". Panini must have lived later than these ten but this is absolutely no help in providing dates since we have absolutely no knowledge of when any of these ten lived. What other internal evidence is there to use? Well of course Panini uses many phrases to illustrate his grammar any these have been examined meticulously to see if anything is contained there to indicate a date. To give an example of what we mean: if we were to pick up a text which contained as an example ""I take the train to work every day"" we would know that it had to have been written after railways became common. Let us illustrate with two actual examples from the Astadhyayi which have been the subject of much study. The first is an attempt to see whether there is evidence of Greek influence. Would it be possible to find evidence which would mean that the text had to have been written after the conquests of Alexander the Great? There is a little evidence of Greek influence, but there was Greek influence on this north east part of the Indian subcontinent before the time of Alexander. Nothing conclusive has been identified.', 'United Kingdom 11 13 8 13 34 12 5 Poland 16 9 22 17 48 27 6 India 11 2 6 13 21 11 7 Czech Republic 10 2 6 4 12 9 8 South Korea 11 2 3 14 19 17 9 Canada (after 2016, Canada Anglophone) 9 2 3 6 11 11 10 Romania 9 2 3 6 11 4 Media coverage [ edit ] Newspaper article in The Age ""It may be semantics, but linguistics can be a team event"".

As one of our graduates, you will have acquired core competencies in programming, algorithms and data structures, advanced mathematics (algebra, logic, statistics), linguistic theories of sound and grammar (syntax, phonetics, phonology) and the computational analysis of natural language (automata theory, complexity theory). You will also have practical experience with existing software solutions and toolkits that are widely used in the industry. This diverse, interdisciplinary skill set will allow you to take on a variety of positions in the IT sector. You will be able to evaluate existing solutions with respect to their linguistic adequacy as well as design and implement new solutions in a rapid prototyping environment. You may also act as the link between teams of linguists and software engineers in large-scale projects.', 'Agent-based models are a powerful way to scientifically understand the computational basis of the enormously complex processes required for music and language. Moreover, once we have agent-based models, we can study systematically and precisely what kind of phenomena emerge at a collective level. For example, agent-based models allow us to ‘bring back to life’ older stages of a language and investigate what mechanisms and factors explain attested historical linguistic developments. The school is intended for postdocs, lecturers and predocs with a background in computer science (artificial intelligence) or computational linguistics (corpus linguistics or natural language processing) and a strong interest in music and the origins of language. There will be background lectures that introduce concepts from biology, anthropology, psychology, music theory and linguistics that are helpful to understand the nature of creativity, the role and intimate relations between language and music, and the mechanisms underlying cultural evolution. It contains technical lectures on the fundamental computational components required for language processing and technical ateliers to learn how to set up evolutionary linguistics experiments. Participants have the opportunity to present their latest research in a poster session. The school also features artistic ateliers in which participants create new creative works and engage in performance. The Cortona Summerschool promises to be an incredibly exciting event, taking place in the setting of the medieval town of Cortona (halfway between Rome and Firenze) in a monastery and Palazzone overlooking the hills and valleys of Tuscany.']"

Glucose is used by your body as energy, and too much of this substance in the bloodstream can lead to medical complications which can become life threatening. If your levels are high you may need to reduce blood sugar by insulin if you are diabetic. Normal blood sugar levels two hours after eating a meal should be less than 140 mg/dL. Testing for fasting blood sugar should give a result between 70-100 mg/dL. Results which are higher than this could indicate early onset diabetes, and should be evaluated by a physician. Results which are lower than 70 mg/dL could indicate hypoglycemia. Because the level of glucose in your blood can vary during the day your doctor may want to test both the fasting level and level after eating. There is a link between sugar and immune system function, and if your blood sugar levels are high this can impair the ability of your immune system to be effective and fight off threats. Keeping normal blood sugar levels will help you stay healthy, and prevent you from catching as many colds and bugs. A fasting blood sugar level is done after you have not had anything to eat or drink for at least eight hours, and this is normally done first thing in the morning after fasting all night.']"

Over many years, these sudden spikes and crashes in blood glucose levels will train the body to ignore the insulin. It does this in an attempt to maintain blood sugar levels stable. We call this stage insulin resistance. It’s the first step towards type-2 diabetes. Now we have a problem. Sugar levels rise in the blood but decrease inside the cells themselves; after all, insulin is not working properly. The cells then send signals to the brain to eat more food, causing sugar cravings. But no matter how much we eat, we can’t seem to give our cells what they want. High blood sugar is dangerous. It can damage our red blood cells, blood vessel linings, kidneys, and lungs. If blood sugar spikes too high, too quickly, then a potentially dangerous, dehydrating condition called hyperglycemic hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome can develop. The body needs to do something else to keep blood sugar levels in check. So it turns to the liver. The liver is now tasked with converting all this excess sugar into something safer, such as fat, leading to increased weight gain and fat deposits in the liver (fatty liver disease). This is the reason for the characteristic “belly fat” many diabetics have. It’s caused by fat deposits forming around the liver and other organs in the abdomen.', 'Dangerous Goods vs Hazardous Substances vs Hazardous Chemicals Hazardous Substances that are and are not Dangerous Goods How to identify Dangerous Goods What are Dangerous Goods What are Hazardous Substances Responsibilities and obligations Dangerous Goods Terminology – Packing Group, UN Number, UN Number Groupings, Proper Shipping Name, Special Classifications, Fire Risk Dangerous Goods, HAZCHEM Code, and more Classification of Dangerous Goods – 9 Classes of Dangerous Goods, including Division and Sub-Risk Structure of Australian Code for the Transport of Dangerous Goods by Road and Rail (ADG Code) Safety Data Sheets (SDS) Packaging and Labelling Hazardous Substances Overview of the Classification of Hazardous Substances Globally Harmonised System for the Classification and Labeling of Chemicals (GHS) GHS vs Approved criteria GHS Pictograms and Labelling Information sources and much more.

Morning Tea and/or Afternoon Tea will be provided depending on which half day Workshop you will be attending. Lunch will be provided to all delegates attending the Introductory Level and Intermediate Level Workshops.', 'Check Blood Sugar Levels You ought to likewise check your blood sugar level promptly at the beginning of the day. This is accomplished with a home glucose monitor and test strips. Water is vital for diabetics. When you have high blood sugar you have a tendency to lose fluid in your body. This can lead to extremely dry and bothersome skin. What’s more, obviously, any splits in the skin can lead to potential disease for a diabetic. Being all around hydrated can be of immense help with this issue. Keep Away From the Diabetic Shock Always carry a snack that you can rapidly eat should your blood sugar levels drop too low. This is known as hypoglycemia and can be very dangerous. Glucose tablets are a snappy emergency fix for a hypoglycemic attack. They work rapidly to raise blood sugar levels out of the danger zone. Power Foods For Diabetics You should eat a healthy meal loaded up with lean proteins, whole grains, fresh vegetables and organic produce. Some excellent power sustenance’s to incorporate into your eating routine include: > Salmon > Tuna > Berries > Greens > Lentils > Oats > Walnuts and Dairy You ought to likewise take a gander at the glycemic index of foods that you consume. Low glycemic foods are the best decision as they won’t spike your blood sugar the way high glycemic food’s will. Continuously design your meals in advance to guarantee that you will eat well and help to keep your blood sugar levels stabilized.', 'The idea that each meal should include starchy carbohydrate (as Diabetes UK posits) is ridiculous and dangerous, in my opinion. When individuals eschew this advice and eat meals comprised of say meat, fish, eggs and non-starchy vegetables (e.g. green leafy vegetables) then their blood sugar control is usually very good. There are many diabetics who have proved this for themselves by self-testing blood sugar levels before and for a couple of hours, say, after eating. Individuals adopting a low-carb diet will also generally see an improvement in levels of HbA1c (also known as glycosylated haemoglobin) which is a marker of overall blood sugar control over the last 3 months or so. Many diabetics, with the right diet, are able to get their HbA1c level into what would be regarded as the normal range. Don’t be expecting such results by following the dietary advice dished out by Diabetes UK, though. Recently, I came across what looks like a whole better on-line resource for individuals with diabetes known as diabetes.co.uk. Diabetes.co.uk (not to be confused with Dabetes UK) describes itself as: “your resource for diabetes, diabetics, diabetes research and education; the leading community website and forum for people with diabetes”. On the homepage, it states: “Diabetes.co.uk is growing as a community of diabetics and non-diabetics alike, offering their own support and first hand knowledge.” I like this last bit, because I’m a great believer in listening to what people who have had success in controlling their diabetes have to say. I don’t have diabetes so I’m not in the best place to judge what works. However, I’ve seen countless individuals report excellent results on adopting a low-carb diet, and it’s these experiences (plus some science) which has led me to conclude this way of eating is, overall, the best for people with diabetes.']"

An optimally functioning metabolism will have fasting glucose levels of no more than 85 mg/dl, though the standard laboratory references call a reading of up to 99 “normal,” which is really too high. Also, blood sugar levels after meals should never spike more than 35 or 40 points above one’s fasting level, and should return to near-fasting level within two hours of eating. The problem is, as one’s blood sugar starts to go awry, after-meal blood sugars can swing into the diabetic range at the two-hour mark. But because doctors typically only measure the fasting glucose, they don’t see this and miss the opportunity for early diagnosis and a higher likelihood of reversal. Blood sugars can swing this way for years before the fasting levels rise to the diabetic range, and at that point, the person usually has some diabetes-related complications. A better test is a glucose tolerance test, where you are given a sugar drink and then have your glucose levels measured at one and two hours. Or you can purchase an inexpensive glucose meter at the drugstore and check your own levels two hours after meals, especially meals high in sugars or carbohydrates. It’s a quick and easy pinprick to the finger. Friends and families might even pitch in for a meter to share so everyone can test. (Each person uses a new, sterile lancet).', 'PDF Button In a previous issue of Weightology Weekly, I wrote about insulin and how it\'s been unfairly demonized by many in the nutrition field. This demonization has been based on a number of misconceptions regarding insulin, its biological effects, and its secretion. I want to continue clarifying these misconceptions. MYTH: Insulin Spikes are ""Bad"" FACT: Insulin Spikes Serve a Normal & Important Physiological Function In my previous article, I discussed how dietary protein can cause insulin spikes just like dietary carbohydrate, and these spikes are not related to gluconeogenesis from the protein (i.e., the protein being converted to sugar). I also showed how these spikes are partly responsible for the suppression of appetite that is caused by dietary protein (due to insulin\'s effects on your brain to inhibit appetite). I want to expand on the importance of rapid insulin spikes due to feeding, and how they are important in blood sugar regulation. To do this, we need to discuss the phases of insulin secretion. Insulin secretion from your pancreas comes in two phases. The first phase happens very quickly; your pancreas senses rising glucose, and insulin is released within 1-2 minutes of this rise in blood sugar. This rapid-phase response is the result of your pancreas releasing stored insulin. It is typically over within 10 minutes. This rapid-phase response has been found to be impaired in people with impaired glucose tolerance (people who have higher blood sugar responses to meals than normal, and higher fasting levels of blood sugar, but who are not diabetic). This rapid-phase response is completely absent in people with type 2 diabetes.', 'Dr. Linda DiMeglio Send › Dr. Linda DiMeglio Send › Thank Disclaimer Get help from a real doctor now Dr. Andrea Brand Board Certified, 7M people helped Continue 111,000 doctors available Related questions What are the major hormones of the pancreas help to regulate blood glucose levels? 1 doctor responded What is the role of the pancrease (pancrelipase) in controlling the blood glucose level? 1 doctor responded Do you know what two hormones interact to control the blood glucose levels? 1 doctor responded Can my blood glucose level rise when I have pain in my stomach post Whipple major operation for pancreatic cancer more Can my blood glucose level rise when I have pain in my stomach post Whipple major operation for pancreatic cancer? 1 doctor responded What is the role of the liver and pancreas in controlling the blood glucose level? 1 doctor responded Could you tell me what hormone is produced by the pancreas which plays a role in regulating blood sugar? 1 doctor responded How do hormones, glucagon and insulin work together to control blood glucose levels? 1 doctor responded How are hormones used by the body to maintain normal blood glucose concentration? 1 doctor responded Hey docs, what hormone controls blood glucose while fasting? 1 doctor responded What hormone controls fasting blood glucose? 1 doctor responded People Also Viewed', 'If you eat more than the recommended five daily servings of fruit plus processed foods with added sugar, your liver can’t deal with the fructose fast enough to use it as fuel. You’re not losing weight because you’re super stressed. The so-called stress hormone cortisol can create all kinds of trouble for women who want to shed weight. When cortisol rises, it encourages the conversion of blood sugar into fat for long-term storage. Hoarding body fat in this way was a useful survival adaptation for our ancestors when they faced stressful famines. Not so much today. Obviously, reducing stress in your life will help rein in this fat-storing hormone, but there’s another very common source of the problem: daily coffee, which elevates cortisol dramatically, causing your body to hoard fat when you least need to. You’re not losing weight because estrogen is literally expanding your fat cells. Although estrogen is responsible for making women uniquely women, it’s also the hormone that can be the most troublesome in the fat department. At normal levels, estrogen actually helps keep you lean by goosing the production of insulin, a hormone that manages blood sugar. When estrogen gets thrown off, though, it turns you into a weight-gain machine. Here’s how: When you eat, your blood sugar rises. Like a bodyguard, insulin lowers it by escorting glucose into three different places in your body. When insulin is in good working form—not too high and not too low—it sends a small amount of glucose to your liver, a large amount to your muscles to use as fuel, and little to none to fat storage. When you’re healthy and in good shape, your pancreas produces exactly the right amount of insulin to have your blood sugar softly rise and fall within a narrow range (fasting levels of 70 to 85 mg/dl). But when your estrogen levels climb, the cells that produce insulin become strained, and you can become insulin resistant. That’s when insulin starts to usher less glucose to the liver and muscles, raising the levels of sugar in your bloodstream and ultimately storing the glucose as fat. Your fat tissue can expand by as much as four times to accommodate the storage of glucose.', 'Researchers have previously investigated whether a period of insulin resistance occurs after the release of hormones, which would also explain how blood glucose levels rise. Do I have dawn phenomenon? There are a number of reasons why high blood sugars can occur in the morning. These can include insufficient insulin or other medication doses, and not accounting for carbohydrate eaten before bed. If you believe that you may be experiencing dawn phenomenon, you should test your blood during the night, between roughly 2:00am and 4:00am. This may help in establishing when your blood glucose levels are rising, and if you can attest the increase to any other factors, or if you are experiencing dawn phenomenon. How to correct dawn phenomenon If your fasting glucose level continues to be high, your doctor will be able to identify dawn phenomenon, if not attributable to other factors, and help you correct it. You may be offered a number of suggestions to help stabilise your morning blood sugar levels, including: Eat dinner earlier in the evening Being active after dinner (such as a walk) Adjusting insulin or other medication dosage Switching to different insulin or other medication Not eating carbohydrate snacks before bed Using an insulin pump to administer extra insulin Your health care provider may prescribe medication if your fasting glucose levels continue to be high.', 'Uncategorized – RISE RISE Home About Cities Interested in bringing RISE to your city?

That’s why the coal mining capitalists in his day seemed to draw a rent on their property which wasn’t really capital, just like the landlords. And the same thing goes to the entire energy sector these days and more than ever, of course, due to the ever rising energy requirements of industry. The manufacturing sector in general is willing to pay that “power rent” to the energy sector, as energy is what amplifies the productivity of labor. Boffy Says: December 5, 2014 at 10:13 am | Reply Marx pointed out long, long ago that the Law of Value is a law of nature, and so cannot be abolished. It simply assumes a different form in each mode of production. As he put it in describing the Law of Value, and his theory of value, in his latter to Kugelmann, ““Every child knows that any nation that stopped working, not for a year, but let us say, just for a few weeks, would perish. And every child knows, too, that the amounts of products corresponding to the differing amounts of needs demand differing and quantitatively determined amounts of society’s aggregate labour. It is self-evident that this necessity of the distribution of social labour in specific proportions is certainly not abolished by the specific form of social production; it can only change its form of manifestation. Natural laws cannot be abolished at all. The only thing that can change, under historically differing conditions, is the form in which those laws assert themselves. And the form in which this proportional distribution of labour asserts itself in a state of society in which the interconnection of social labour expresses itself as the private exchange of the individual products of labour, is precisely the exchange value of these products.”', 'Ra: I am Ra.

Am I wrong? My memory is a little fuzzy on this. Ra: I am Ra. It is not that you are incorrect but that no conclusions should be drawn from such information. There are several different types of bases for conscious entities not only upon this planetary sphere but to a much greater extent in the forms found on planetary spheres of other sub-Logoi. The chemical vehicle is that which most conveniently houses the consciousness. The functioning of consciousness is the item of interest rather than the chemical makeup of a physical vehicle. We have observed that those whom you call scientists have puzzled over the various differences and possible interrelationships of various stages, types, and conditions of life-forms. This is not fruitful material as it is that which is of a moment’s choice by your sub-Logos.

Each step recapitulates intelligent infinity in its discovery of awareness. In a planetary environment all begins in what you would call chaos, energy undirected and random in its infinity. Slowly, in your terms of understanding, there forms a focus of self-awareness. Thus the Logos moves. Light comes to form the darkness, according to the co-Creator’s patterns and vibratory rhythms, so constructing a certain type of experience. This begins with first density which is the density of consciousness, the mineral and water life upon the planet learning from fire and wind the awareness of being.

To define biomass energy, you have to look at how many different forms of energy different forms of biomass can be broken down into. NileFiber has the ability to be broken down into many different products, helping people around the world, making it an ideal form of biomass energy. It can be used for products such as building materials and chemicals, for energy such as fuels and electricity, or even for environmental protection by way of reducing soil erosion, phytoremediation of polluted sites, or sequestering the carbon dioxide generated from all of the fossil fuels that we currently use. Biomass energy is the one form of energy that can have a huge impact without actually taking up a huge amount of space, and NileFiber allows for that space to be even smaller than other forms of biomass. This is due in part to the higher yields per acre vs. other biomass crops. What is renewable energy? Renewable energy is a sustainable form of energy that can easily be made or reproduced without a negative environmental impact. This is part of what makes NileFiber a clear choice for many of the world’s industries. Many products can be made from NileFiber and can be harvested each and every year, and the yield per acre is much greater than standard tree products, allowing for a greater yearly harvest than any other renewable form of biomass that is currently being used.']"

Motion energy Motion energy – also known as mechanical energy – is the energy stored in moving objects. As the object moves faster, more energy is stored. Motion energy is the sum of potential and kinetic energy in an object that is used to do work. Burning Questions What is motion energy? Motion – or mechanical – energy is the energy stored in moving objects. So motion energy must be a form of kinetic energy, right? Well, not quite. Motion energy is actually the sum of kinetic and potential energy in an object that is used to do work. What do you mean by 'work'? Work is when a force acts on an object and causes it to move, change shape or position, or do something physical."", 'powerelectronics » Power Conversion, Intelligent Motion Power Conversion, Intelligent Motion Artificial Intelligence Blog powerelectronics The Types of Motion Technology Blog Comments Off on The Types of Motion Mar 062017 There are two types of fundamental motion: interpretation and pivot. Interpretation implies motion along a way. Turn implies motion around a settled pivot. A pivot is the middle around which something turns. As we have specified some time recently, each type of motion is energy match opinie check it out controlled by an alternate type of constrain. Interpretation is characterized by the net drive (aggregate of various strengths) following up on a protest. Revolution is characterized by torque. Torque is a drive which causes the turn of a question. Everything normally needs to move and change. In the realm of mechanics, there are four essential types of motion. These four are turning, swaying, direct and responding. Every one moves in a somewhat extraordinary manner and each type of accomplished utilizing distinctive mechanical implies http://wybierztanigaz.pl/ tani gaz that help us comprehend straight motion and motion control. Motion is development, and it can likewise be characterized as a constant change in the position of a protest along a particular vector. Each type of motion is controlled by an alternate type of drive. Vibrational motion happens due to the vibration or swaying of a question. For instance, a spring fixing to a question toward one side and fixing to a roof at the flip side sways when it is compacted and released.Physics is about the cognizant comprehension of motion, however we’re clearly not promptly arranged to comprehend the most confused https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics) types of motion. Rather, we’ll utilize the separation andconquer strategy. We’ll first arrange the different types of motion, and after that start our crusade with an assault on the most straightforward cases. To make it clear what we are and are not prepared to consider, we have to look at and characterize painstakingly what types of motion can exist. Motion is the activity of changing area or position. The investigation of motion without respect to the powers or energies that might be included is called kinematics. It is the easiest branch of mechanics. The branch of mechanics that arrangements with both motion and strengths together is called progression and the investigation of powers without changes in motion or energy is called statics.']"

It’s better talk about finding a ‘stationary point’: a place where the derivative of something is zero. More importantly, what is this something? We’ll have to see—indeed, we’ll have to see if this whole idea makes sense! But for now, let’s just call it ‘quantropy’. This is a goofy word whose only virtue is that it quickly gets the idea across: just as the main ideas in statistical mechanics follow from the idea of maximizing entropy, we’d like the main ideas in quantum mechanics to follow from maximizing… err, well, finding a stationary point… of ‘quantropy’. I don’t know how well this idea works, but there’s no way to know except by trying, so I’ll try it here. I got this idea thanks to a nudge from Uwe Stroinski and WebHubTel, who started talking about the principle of least action and the principle of maximum entropy at a moment when I was thinking hard about probabilities versus amplitudes. Of course, if this idea makes sense, someone probably had it already. If you know where, please tell me. Here’s the story… Statics Static systems at temperature zero obey the principle of minimum energy. Energy is typically the sum of kinetic and potential energy: where the potential energy depends only on the system’s position, while the kinetic energy also depends on its velocity. The kinetic energy is often (but not always) a quadratic function of velocity with a minimum at velocity zero. In classical physics this lets our system minimize energy in a two-step way. First it will minimize kinetic energy, by staying still. Then it will go on to minimize potential energy, by choosing the right place to stay still.', 'I think you’d probably have a queue of helioseismologists wanting to pick arguments with you if you said that on the floor of a conference hall. Not at all, the examples you cite are not about the waves, but about what we have learned using the waves, such as flows inside the sun, the rotation rates in the interior, circulations driven by thermal differences, etc. The Howe observations are old and didn’t hold up with later data. The second example: “The spectrum of the detected oscillations arises from modes with periods ranging from about 1.5 minutes to about 20 minutes and with horizontal wavelengths of between less then a few thousand kilometers to the length of the solar globe” just affirms what I said about the oscillations being short lived [minutes]. tallbloke says: May 27, 2011 at 1:36 am Leif Svalgaard says: May 26, 2011 at 6:39 pm Wolf and Patrone have no mechanism for transferring potential energy into actual kinetic energy.

Instead, it is simply transferred from one type of energy to another, or from one form of energy to another. The difference between mechanical energy and kinetic energy is that kinetic energy is a type of energy, while mechanical energy is a form of energy. Energy Transfer Work can be defined as the process of energy transfer whereby a force acts upon an object to cause a displacement. If an object is moved, then work has been performed. Work requires three things: a force, a displacement and a cause. For example, if you picked up a book and placed it on the top shelf of a bookshelf, the force would be you lifting the book, the displacement would be the movement of the book and the cause of the movement would be the force you applied. Types of Energy There are two types of energy: potential and kinetic. Potential energy is energy that is stored in an object due to its position. This type of energy is not in use but is available to do work. For example, the book possesses potential energy when it is stationary on the top of the bookshelf. Kinetic energy is energy that is possessed by an object due to its motion. For example, if the book were to fall off the shelf, it would possess kinetic energy as it fell. All energy is either potential or kinetic. Forms of Energy Mechanical energy is a form of energy. It represents the energy that is possessed by a mechanical system or device due to its motion or position. Stated differently, mechanical energy is the ability of an object to do work. Mechanical energy can be either kinetic (energy in motion) or potential (energy that is stored). The sum of an object's kinetic and potential energy equals the object's total mechanical energy. Other forms of energy include chemical, nuclear, electromagnetic, thermal and sound. Kinetic vs. Mechanical The difference between kinetic and mechanical energy is that kinetic is a type of energy, while mechanical is a form that energy takes. For instance, a bow that has been drawn and a bow that is launching an arrow are both examples of mechanical energy. However, they do not both have the same type of energy. The drawn bow is an example of potential energy, because the energy necessary to launch the arrow is only being stored in the bow; while the bow in motion is an example of kinetic energy, because it is doing work. If the arrow strikes a bell, some of its energy will be converted to sound energy. It will no longer be mechanical energy, but it will still be kinetic energy.

Wang Otolaryngology Research output: Chapter in Book/Report/Conference proceeding › Conference contribution Abstract Studying the sound stimulated vibrations of various membranes that form the complex structure of the organ of Corti in the cochlea of the inner ear is essential for understanding how the travelling sound wave of the basilar membrane couples its energy to the organ structures. In this paper we report the feasibility of using phase-sensitive Fourier domain optical coherence tomography (FD-OCT) to image the vibration of various micro-structures of the cochlea at the same time. An excised cochlea of a guinea pig was stimulated using sounds at various frequencies and vibration image was obtained. When measuring the apex area, vibration signal from different turns, which have different best response frequencies are obtained in the same image. The method has the potential to measure the response from a much wider region of the cochlea than any other currently used method. The noise floor for vibration image for the system at 200 Hz was ~0.3nm.', 'DOE requests information on whether products with multiple automatic icemakers should be tested differently than the more typical single automatic icemaker models—and if so, how. DOE seeks consumer use data for these products to inform whether a different energy use adder or test procedure would be appropriate for these dual-icemaker products. C. Built-In Test Configuration In the 2013 NOPR, DOE presented data indicating that testing in a built-in enclosure may affect energy consumption for certain configurations of built-in products. Specifically, those products that reject condenser heat at the back of the unit showed a potential increase in energy use when tested in an enclosure. DOE observed no significant change in energy use associated with the test configuration for those products that reject heat from the front of the unit. DOE requested comment on the appropriate test configuration for built-in refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers, and freezers, (78 FR 46149-46150). Similar to the icemaking test issue, DOE provided additional time to comment on the built-in testing issue prior to the 2014 final rule, but did not address the issue in that rule. In the rulemaking leading to the 2014 final rule, DOE received multiple comments. Some commenters supported testing built-in products in an enclosure, as this would represent how the products are used in the field. (Joint Commenters, No. 42 at pp. 5-6; Northwest Energy Efficiency Alliance and Northwest Power & Conservation Council, No. 41 at p. 4) Others opposed the enclosure approach, noting the significant increase in test burden with little or no corresponding change in measured energy consumption. These interested parties also noted that for the products showing a difference in measured energy use between the freestanding and enclosure setups, the enclosure configuration that DOE used (based on Underwriters Laboratories (UL) 250, “Household Refrigerators and Freezers”) was not necessarily consistent with manufacturer installation instructions.

Let's check out this conceptual conservation of energy question. Here we have two cylinders of equal mass and radius, so basically the same cylinder. TheyÕre released from rest from the top of two hills having the same height. It's the two very similar or so far identical situations. Let's say I have cylinder A on hill A and cylinder B on hill B. Everything is the same except that A rolls without slipping. That means that it's not only going to have a V, but it's also rolling so it has a _. Remember this is called rolling motion if you roll without slipping and it means that Vcm = R_, but B slides without rolling. Those are the two options you can have. It's either going to roll without slipping or it's going to slip without rolling. You can have both. You could but it's more complicated. You're not going to see that. What this means is that it's moving this way with a V but it has no _. Basically it's falling, it's going down as a box would. You can think of this as a box going down because it doesn't roll. Before we answer the question, I want to talk about how that's even possible. Basically, the difference is that here you have just enough static friction to cause this thing to roll. Remember, you need static friction to have an angular acceleration when you have a rolling problem. Here you have a situation where the hill is different for whatever reason and there is no static friction, which is why it doesn't roll. The question is who gets to the bottom with the fastest speed? Is VAf or VBf going to be the greater one? I want you to take a guess or just sort of try to figure this out. Think about which one do you think would get to the bottom first. Most people get this question, they guess this question wrong. Most people say that this one will get to the bottom first and I suspect it has to do with the fact that you're going to think that objects that roll are faster than objects that slide and that's probably because you associate sliding with some friction slowing you down or you associate rolling with wheels and wheels are fast because we have wheels and cars. But in reality, the one that gets to the bottom with the greater speed is this one. Why is that? That's because of conservation of energy. Conservation of energy. K initial + U initial + Work non-conservative = K final + U final. In both of these situations, the kinetic energy in the beginning is 0. I have some potential energy. The work done by non-conservative forces is 0 as well. You don't do anything. You're just watching. In the first problem, there is in the first case, there is static friction but the work done by static friction is 0. It actually even though there is static friction, it doesn't do any work. There is some kinetic at the end and there is no potential at the end. All we have is that my potential energy in the beginning goes into kinetic final at the end. If they start from the same height and they have the same mass and everything, they have the same potential energy for both of them. Let's say that number is 100 Joules. In both problems, you start with 100 Joules and then you roll to the bottom. The difference is that in the first situation, for A the 100 joules is going to get split between kinetic linear and kinetic rotational because it has two types of energies. Let's make up some numbers here. Let's say that 80 goes here and 20. I'm sorry, I meant kinetic linear and kinetic rotational. Let's say 80 goes to linear, 20 goes to rotational. Totally making this up. For B, the entire amount, the entire 100 Joules is going to go into kinetic linear because there is no kinetic rotational, because it doesn't roll around itself. Notice how this guy ends up with a greater kinetic energy than A and that's irrespective of the division. No matter how these two numbers get balanced out, the 100 will always be bigger even if this was 10 and 90, 100 is still greater. One way to think about this, so the answer is that it's basically because this has one type of kinetic energy, and this one has two types of kinetic. One way to think about this is to think about energy as money. It's expensive to get some sort of energy going on. You're using up your potential energy and transforming into kinetic. If you're falling and rolling, it takes a little bit of energy to get it to move and it takes a little bit of energy to get it to roll. Rolling costs you some energy therefore some of the energy that would have gone here is actually going here to cause you to roll. In fact the faster you roll, the more rotational energy you have so there's less energy that's left for your linear, for your V. Your W is stealing energy from your V, so you end up with a lower V.

Just before the moon emerges into visible crescent form it will pass through a sextile with Uranus in Aries, highlighting that we have entered the final month of Uranus being in Aries. Uranus first entered Aries in 2010, immediately intensifying a catalytic square aspect with Pluto in Capricorn that dominated astrology through 2016. Richard Tarnas in Cosmos and Psyche described the Uranus and Pluto cycle as inciting “radical social and political change and often destructive upheaval, massive empowerment of revolutionary and rebellious impulses . . . intensified artistic and intellectual creativity . . . unusually rapid technological advance, an underlying spirit of restless experiment, drive for innovation, urge for freedom in many realms, revolt against oppression, embrace of radical political philosophies, and intensified collective will to bring forth a new world.” We will still be within the influence of the Uranus-Pluto square, but after Uranus enters Taurus and is no longer in a sign-based square with Pluto its edge will be less sharp. Yet, since Uranus is separating away from Pluto while Saturn is applying to Pluto, the influence of the Saturn and Pluto cycle has been more viscerally felt. Richard Tarnas in Cosmos and Psyche described the Saturn and Pluto cycle as being about “conservative empowerment,” as its cycle aligns with “eras of international crisis and conflict, empowerment of reactionary forces and totalitarian impulses, organized violence and oppression . . . An atmosphere of gravity and tension.” Significantly, Mars in Aries has moved through a square aspect with both Saturn and Pluto in Capricorn and is now applying toward a conjunction with Uranus, bringing both cycles together on personal and societal levels.', 'Moon, Mars and Pluto in Leo The Moon in Leo gives a warm, enthusiastic and dramatic personality. There is more Leo in the chart from an explosively creative close Mars-Pluto conjunction. A Leo Mars carrying the creative power (and egomania!) of the Pluto in Leo generation, combines smoothly with the inspired intelligence, adaptability and potential mastery of language and communication shown by the Gemini Saturn-Uranus conjunction. McCartney is still fond of describing himself as working class – “I work bloody hard” – and that strongly positioned Mars in Leo is a sure sign that he does. Egypt Station arrived with a Uranus transit to his Mars in Leo Looking at recent transits and progressions, and after having allowed for the question mark around his time of birth, one relevant transit stands out. In the couple of months before Egypt Station was released in September 2018, transiting Uranus made (or came very close to) an exact stationary square to Paul McCartney’s natal Mars in Leo. At that time, McCartney was very busy making unexpected (Uranus) playful promotional appearances (Mars in Leo). He popped up in New York, on the internet, television, in fact just about everywhere! Using the 2pm chart (above), Uranus is transiting from his 8th house, to Mars which is the ruler of his 8th house. Not only has Egypt Station suddenly regenerated (Uranus in 8th house) his career, there are also many more 8th house themes (emotional crises, sex, even some kind of spiritual salvation) in the lyrics than is usual for Paul. The final pass of this Uranus transit is in mid to late April of 2019, so worth keeping an eye out for some more unpredictable and playful Mars in Leo action from him then.']"

Chiron’s orbit Touches the Soul (goes out just beyond Uranus’s orbit), then returns to bring a Message to the Ego (comes back inside the orbit of Saturn).', 'Magnetic Riddles The orientation of Uranus’ magnetic field is quite unusual. Most planets have a magnetic field that is approximately aligned with their rotation axis. Not so with Uranus. The magnetic axis is offset from the rotation axis by an astonishing 60 degrees. Moreover, the magnetic axis does not pass through the center of the planet but is offset to one side by roughly one third the radius of the planet. From a secular perspective, it is mystifying that Uranus should have a magnetic field at all. Magnetic fields naturally decay with time and should be nonexistent in planets that are billions of years old. On the other hand, the magnetic field of Uranus fits perfectly with biblical creation. In 1984, creation physicist Russ Humphreys predicted the magnetic field of Uranus based on the amount of magnetic decay that would have happened on the planet in the 6,000 years since its creation.11 Voyager 2 confirmed this prediction. Although the presence of a strong magnetic field on any planet is a confirmation of recent creation, this is especially the case for Uranus. Here’s why this challenges the secular view: To salvage their belief in billions of years from the contrary evidence of planetary magnetic fields, secular astronomers usually invoke a magnetic dynamo. A dynamo is a device that turns mechanical energy into the electrical current necessary for a magnetic field. Secular scientists have proposed that mechanical motion due to heat in a planet’s interior somehow forms a dynamo, thereby regenerating the planet’s magnetic field over millions and even billions of years. But of the four giant planets in our solar system, Uranus alone lacks any measureable internal heat. So, there is no power source for the dynamo. Also, dynamo models predict that the magnetic field axis must be fairly well aligned with the rotation axis. Uranus violates this condition as well.', 'Spanish language & walking in Spain The Picos de Europa region in northern Spain is an area where walking and talking are part of the landscape, so imagine being able to walk with a native Spanish speaker after a morning of Spanish language lessons.

Choi 2019-07-10T19:14:05Z Reference Article: Facts About Uranus Shares Uranus’ tilt essentially has the planet orbiting the Sun on its side, the axis of its spin is nearly pointing at the Sun. (Image: © NASA and Erich Karkoschka, U. of Arizona) Uranus is the seventh planet from the sun and the first to be discovered by scientists. Although Uranus is visible to the naked eye, it was long mistaken as a star because of the planet\'s dimness and slow orbit. The planet is also notable for its dramatic tilt, which causes its axis to point nearly directly at the sun. British astronomer William Herschel discovered Uranus on March 13, 1781, with his telescope while surveying all stars down to those about 10 times dimmer than can be seen by the naked eye. One star seemed different, and within a year Herschel realized the star followed a planetary orbit. Uranus (as it was called commonly after 1850 or so) was named after the Greek sky deity Ouranos, the earliest of the lords of the heavens. It is the only planet to be named after a Greek god rather than a Roman one. Before the name was settled on, many names had been proposed for the new planet, including Hypercronius (""above Saturn""), Minerva (the Roman goddess of wisdom) and Herschel, after its discoverer. To flatter King George III of England, Herschel proposed the name Georgium Sidus (""The Georgian Planet""), but the idea was unpopular outside England and King George\'s native Hanover, Germany. German astronomer Johann Bode, who detailed Uranus\' orbit, gave the planet its ultimate name. Bode argued that as Saturn was the father of Jupiter, the new planet should be named for the father of Saturn. [ Related: How Do You Pronounce \'Uranus\'? ] Physical characteristics Uranus is blue-green in color, as a result of the methane in its mostly hydrogen-helium atmosphere. The planet is often dubbed an ice giant, since at least 80% of its mass is a fluid mix of water, methane and ammonia ice. Unlike the other planets of the solar system, Uranus is tilted so far that it essentially orbits the sun on its side, with the axis of its spin nearly pointing at the star. This unusual orientation might be due to a collision with a planet-size body, or several small bodies, soon after it was formed. A 2018 study suggested the colliding world could have been twice the size of Earth . This unusual tilt gives rise to extreme seasons that last for about 20 years. This means that for nearly a quarter of the Uranian year, which is equal to 84 Earth-years, the sun shines directly over each pole, leaving the other half of the planet to experience a long, dark and frigid winter. Uranus has the coldest atmosphere of any of the planets in the solar system, even though it is not the most distant from the sun. That\'s because Uranus has little to no internal heat to supplement the heat from the sun. The magnetic poles of most planets are typically more or less lined up with the axis along which it rotates, but Uranus\' magnetic field is tilted, with its magnetic axis tipped nearly 60 degrees away from the planet\'s axis of rotation. This leads to a strangely lopsided magnetic field for Uranus, with the strength of the field at the northern hemisphere\'s surface being up to more than 10 times that of the strength at the southern hemisphere\'s surface. A 2017 study suggested the lopsided nature of Uranus\' magnetic field may also lead it to flicker on and off during every rotation (about every 17.24 hours). Uranus\' atmospheric composition by volume is 82.5% hydrogen, 15.2% helium and 2.3% methane. Its internal structure is made up of a mantle of water, ammonia and methane ices, as well as a core of iron and magnesium silicate. Uranus\' average distance from the sun is roughly 1.8 billion miles (2.9 billion km), according to NASA . That’s about 19 times the distance from the Earth to the sun. (Image credit: Karl Tate, SPACE.com) Uranus\' climate The extreme axial tilt Uranus experiences can give rise to unusual weather. As sunlight reaches some areas for the first time in years, it heats up the atmosphere, triggering gigantic springtime storms, according to NASA. However, when Voyager 2 first imaged Uranus in 1986 at the height of summer in its south, the spacecraft saw a bland-looking sphere with only about 10 or so visible clouds, leading to it to be dubbed ""the most boring planet,"" wrote astronomer Heidi Hammel in ""The Ice Giant Systems of Uranus and Neptune,"" a chapter in ""Solar System Update"" (Springer, 2007), a compilation of reviews in solar system science. It was decades later, when advanced telescopes such as Hubble came into play and Uranus\' long seasons changed, before scientists witnessed the extreme weather on Uranus. In 2014 , astronomers got their first glimpse at summer storms raging on Uranus. Strangely, these massive storms took place seven years after the planet reached its closest approach to the sun, and it remains a mystery why the giant storms occurred after the sun’s heating on the planet was at a maximum. Other unusual weather on Uranus includes diamond rain , which is thought to sink thousands of miles below the surface of icy giant planets such as Uranus and Neptune. Carbon and hydrogen are thought to compress under extreme heat and pressure deep in the atmospheres of these planets to form diamonds, which are then thought to sink downward, eventually settling around the cores of those worlds. Yes, Uranus has rings The rings of Uranus were the first to be seen after Saturn\'s. They were a significant discovery, because it helped astronomers understand that rings are a common feature of planets, not merely a peculiarity of Saturn. Uranus possesses two sets of rings. The inner system of rings consists mostly of narrow, dark rings, while an outer system of two more-distant rings, discovered by the Hubble Space Telescope, are brightly colored: one red, one blue. Scientists have identified 13 known rings around Uranus. A 2016 study suggested that the rings of Uranus, Saturn and Neptune may be the remnants of Pluto-like dwarf planets that strayed too close to the giant worlds long ago. These dwarf planets were torn apart in the planets’ vast gravities and are today preserved as rings. The Hubble Space Telescope observes Uranus every year. This view, in near infrared light, highlights not only the planet\'s rings but also atmospheric belts and clouds. (Image credit: NASA/JPL/STScI) Uranus also has moons Uranus has 27 known moons . Instead of being named after figures from Greek or Roman mythology, its first four moons were named after magical spirits in English literature, such as William Shakespeare\'s ""A Midsummer Night\'s Dream"" and Alexander Pope\'s ""The Rape of the Lock."" Since then, astronomers have continued this tradition, drawing names for the moons from the works of Shakespeare or Pope. Oberon and Titania are the largest Uranian moons, and were the first to be discovered, by Herschel in 1787. William Lassell, who was also the first to see a moon orbiting Neptune, discovered Uranus\' next two moons, Ariel and Umbriel. Nearly a century passed before Dutch-American astronomer Gerard Kuiper, he of Kuiper Belt fame, found Miranda in 1948. In 1986, Voyager 2 visited the Uranian system and discovered an additional 10 moons, all just 16 to 96 miles (26 to154 km) in diameter:Juliet, Puck, Cordelia, Ophelia, Bianca, Desdemona, Portia, Rosalind, Cressida and Belinda. Each of those moons are roughly half water ice and half rock. Since then, astronomers using Hubble and ground-based observatories have raised the total to 27 known moons, and spotting these was tricky — they are as little as 8 to 10 miles (12 to 16 km) across, blacker than asphalt and nearly 3 billion miles (4.8 billion km) away. Between Cordelia, Ophelia and Miranda is a swarm of eight small satellites crowded together so tightly that astronomers don\'t yet understand how the little moons have managed to avoid crashing into each other. Anomalies in Uranus\' rings lead scientists to suspect there might still be more moons . In addition to moons, Uranus may have a collection of Trojan asteroids — objects that share the same orbit as the planet — in a special region known as a Lagrange point . The first was discovered in 2013, despite claims that the planet\'s Lagrange point would be too unstable to host such bodies. Uranus and its five major moons are depicted in this montage of images acquired by the Voyager 2 spacecraft. The moons, from largest to smallest as they appear here, are Ariel, Miranda, Titania, Oberon and Umbriel. (Image credit: NASA/JPL) Research & exploration NASA\'s Voyager 2 was the first and as yet, only spacecraft to visit Uranus. Although there isn\'t a spacecraft on its way to Uranus at the moment, astronomers regularly check in with the planet using the Hubble and Keck telescopes. In 2011, the Planetary Science Decadal Survey recommended that NASA consider a mission to the icy planet. And in 2017 , NASA suggested a number of potential future missions to Uranus in support of the forthcoming Planetary Science Decadal Survey, including flybys, orbiters and even a spacecraft to dive into Uranus\' atmosphere. Scientists are still discussing the idea. In 2019, NASA\'s Goddard Space Flight Center suggested one possible design could involve an atmospheric probe , similar to the one used in Jupiter during the Galileo mission. In 2018, an ambitious group of early-career scientists and engineers created a theoretical full mission design that would cost $1 billion, and take advantage of a planetary alignment that would happen in the 2030s. At that relatively low cost, the mission would perform minimal science, but could still include items such as a magnetometer, a methane detector and a camera.

They knew the Moon is 60 times as far from the centre of the Earth as an observer on the surface of the earth is, so Earth’s field of acceleration due to gravity is 60*60 = 3,600 times weaker at the Moon than at the Earth’s surface. Hence the acceleration needed to keep the Moon in its orbit, equal to a = v2/r (the square of its orbital speed divided by the distance of the Moon from the centre of the Earth) = 0.003 ms-2 should be 3,600 times weaker than the acceleration due to gravity measured by Galileo on Earth’s surface.

In 2014 , astronomers got their first glimpse at summer storms raging on Uranus. Strangely, these massive storms took place seven years after the planet reached its closest approach to the sun, and it remains a mystery why the giant storms occurred after the sun’s heating on the planet was at a maximum. Other unusual weather on Uranus includes diamond rain , which is thought to sink thousands of miles below the surface of icy giant planets such as Uranus and Neptune. Carbon and hydrogen are thought to compress under extreme heat and pressure deep in the atmospheres of these planets to form diamonds, which are then thought to sink downward, eventually settling around the cores of those worlds. Yes, Uranus has rings The rings of Uranus were the first to be seen after Saturn\'s. They were a significant discovery, because it helped astronomers understand that rings are a common feature of planets, not merely a peculiarity of Saturn. Uranus possesses two sets of rings. The inner system of rings consists mostly of narrow, dark rings, while an outer system of two more-distant rings, discovered by the Hubble Space Telescope, are brightly colored: one red, one blue. Scientists have identified 13 known rings around Uranus. A 2016 study suggested that the rings of Uranus, Saturn and Neptune may be the remnants of Pluto-like dwarf planets that strayed too close to the giant worlds long ago. These dwarf planets were torn apart in the planets’ vast gravities and are today preserved as rings. The Hubble Space Telescope observes Uranus every year. This view, in near infrared light, highlights not only the planet\'s rings but also atmospheric belts and clouds. (Image credit: NASA/JPL/STScI) Uranus also has moons Uranus has 27 known moons . Instead of being named after figures from Greek or Roman mythology, its first four moons were named after magical spirits in English literature, such as William Shakespeare\'s ""A Midsummer Night\'s Dream"" and Alexander Pope\'s ""The Rape of the Lock."" Since then, astronomers have continued this tradition, drawing names for the moons from the works of Shakespeare or Pope. Oberon and Titania are the largest Uranian moons, and were the first to be discovered, by Herschel in 1787. William Lassell, who was also the first to see a moon orbiting Neptune, discovered Uranus\' next two moons, Ariel and Umbriel. Nearly a century passed before Dutch-American astronomer Gerard Kuiper, he of Kuiper Belt fame, found Miranda in 1948. In 1986, Voyager 2 visited the Uranian system and discovered an additional 10 moons, all just 16 to 96 miles (26 to154 km) in diameter:Juliet, Puck, Cordelia, Ophelia, Bianca, Desdemona, Portia, Rosalind, Cressida and Belinda. Each of those moons are roughly half water ice and half rock. Since then, astronomers using Hubble and ground-based observatories have raised the total to 27 known moons, and spotting these was tricky — they are as little as 8 to 10 miles (12 to 16 km) across, blacker than asphalt and nearly 3 billion miles (4.8 billion km) away. Between Cordelia, Ophelia and Miranda is a swarm of eight small satellites crowded together so tightly that astronomers don\'t yet understand how the little moons have managed to avoid crashing into each other. Anomalies in Uranus\' rings lead scientists to suspect there might still be more moons . In addition to moons, Uranus may have a collection of Trojan asteroids — objects that share the same orbit as the planet — in a special region known as a Lagrange point . The first was discovered in 2013, despite claims that the planet\'s Lagrange point would be too unstable to host such bodies. Uranus and its five major moons are depicted in this montage of images acquired by the Voyager 2 spacecraft. The moons, from largest to smallest as they appear here, are Ariel, Miranda, Titania, Oberon and Umbriel. (Image credit: NASA/JPL) Research & exploration NASA\'s Voyager 2 was the first and as yet, only spacecraft to visit Uranus. Although there isn\'t a spacecraft on its way to Uranus at the moment, astronomers regularly check in with the planet using the Hubble and Keck telescopes. In 2011, the Planetary Science Decadal Survey recommended that NASA consider a mission to the icy planet. And in 2017 , NASA suggested a number of potential future missions to Uranus in support of the forthcoming Planetary Science Decadal Survey, including flybys, orbiters and even a spacecraft to dive into Uranus\' atmosphere. Scientists are still discussing the idea. In 2019, NASA\'s Goddard Space Flight Center suggested one possible design could involve an atmospheric probe , similar to the one used in Jupiter during the Galileo mission. In 2018, an ambitious group of early-career scientists and engineers created a theoretical full mission design that would cost $1 billion, and take advantage of a planetary alignment that would happen in the 2030s. At that relatively low cost, the mission would perform minimal science, but could still include items such as a magnetometer, a methane detector and a camera.

Choi 2019-07-10T19:14:05Z Reference Article: Facts About Uranus Shares Uranus’ tilt essentially has the planet orbiting the Sun on its side, the axis of its spin is nearly pointing at the Sun. (Image: © NASA and Erich Karkoschka, U. of Arizona) Uranus is the seventh planet from the sun and the first to be discovered by scientists. Although Uranus is visible to the naked eye, it was long mistaken as a star because of the planet\'s dimness and slow orbit. The planet is also notable for its dramatic tilt, which causes its axis to point nearly directly at the sun. British astronomer William Herschel discovered Uranus on March 13, 1781, with his telescope while surveying all stars down to those about 10 times dimmer than can be seen by the naked eye. One star seemed different, and within a year Herschel realized the star followed a planetary orbit. Uranus (as it was called commonly after 1850 or so) was named after the Greek sky deity Ouranos, the earliest of the lords of the heavens. It is the only planet to be named after a Greek god rather than a Roman one. Before the name was settled on, many names had been proposed for the new planet, including Hypercronius (""above Saturn""), Minerva (the Roman goddess of wisdom) and Herschel, after its discoverer. To flatter King George III of England, Herschel proposed the name Georgium Sidus (""The Georgian Planet""), but the idea was unpopular outside England and King George\'s native Hanover, Germany. German astronomer Johann Bode, who detailed Uranus\' orbit, gave the planet its ultimate name. Bode argued that as Saturn was the father of Jupiter, the new planet should be named for the father of Saturn. [ Related: How Do You Pronounce \'Uranus\'? ] Physical characteristics Uranus is blue-green in color, as a result of the methane in its mostly hydrogen-helium atmosphere. The planet is often dubbed an ice giant, since at least 80% of its mass is a fluid mix of water, methane and ammonia ice. Unlike the other planets of the solar system, Uranus is tilted so far that it essentially orbits the sun on its side, with the axis of its spin nearly pointing at the star. This unusual orientation might be due to a collision with a planet-size body, or several small bodies, soon after it was formed. A 2018 study suggested the colliding world could have been twice the size of Earth . This unusual tilt gives rise to extreme seasons that last for about 20 years. This means that for nearly a quarter of the Uranian year, which is equal to 84 Earth-years, the sun shines directly over each pole, leaving the other half of the planet to experience a long, dark and frigid winter. Uranus has the coldest atmosphere of any of the planets in the solar system, even though it is not the most distant from the sun. That\'s because Uranus has little to no internal heat to supplement the heat from the sun. The magnetic poles of most planets are typically more or less lined up with the axis along which it rotates, but Uranus\' magnetic field is tilted, with its magnetic axis tipped nearly 60 degrees away from the planet\'s axis of rotation. This leads to a strangely lopsided magnetic field for Uranus, with the strength of the field at the northern hemisphere\'s surface being up to more than 10 times that of the strength at the southern hemisphere\'s surface. A 2017 study suggested the lopsided nature of Uranus\' magnetic field may also lead it to flicker on and off during every rotation (about every 17.24 hours). Uranus\' atmospheric composition by volume is 82.5% hydrogen, 15.2% helium and 2.3% methane. Its internal structure is made up of a mantle of water, ammonia and methane ices, as well as a core of iron and magnesium silicate. Uranus\' average distance from the sun is roughly 1.8 billion miles (2.9 billion km), according to NASA . That’s about 19 times the distance from the Earth to the sun. (Image credit: Karl Tate, SPACE.com) Uranus\' climate The extreme axial tilt Uranus experiences can give rise to unusual weather. As sunlight reaches some areas for the first time in years, it heats up the atmosphere, triggering gigantic springtime storms, according to NASA.

The different sides of the planet are pulled to different degrees, with the side closest to the star receiving a small but noticeably larger pull. This bends the planet out of shape, from a ball into an ellipse. No water is necessary for this to happen. Even solid rock stretched out — the surfaces of both the Earth and the Moon stretch toward each other. This stretching doesn\'t happen immediately, though. It takes time for the planet to stretch its solid mass towards the sun and to settle back, and while it is stretching and settling, it is moving. At first, it is moving in two different ways. It is rotating on its axis, the way the Earth does to produce night and day. It is also orbiting the star, as the Earth does to produce a year. Those two movements rarely sync up. For example, sometimes the rotation speeds past the orbit. In that case, instead of the bulges in the ellipse ""pointing"" directly at and away from the star, they turn past it. The problem is, the near bulge is closer to the star than the rest of the planet, and it feels a gravitational pull dragging it backwards — so it\'s once again aligned with the center of the star. It doesn\'t necessarily get pulled all the way back, but it gets shifted a little bit. That shift happens every time the planet rotates. If the rotation is too slow and the orbit is fast, the bulge lags behind as the planet orbits forward, and the gravitational pull of the star drags it forward. No matter what, the planet gets a tug until its rotation is exactly the same period of time as its orbit. When that happens, it\'s tidally locked. It shows one face to the sun at all times.', 'Conclusion The first planet to be discovered in modern times, Uranus is a diverse world of unique splendor. Its sky-blue disk is an enjoyable sight in a backyard telescope, and to spot its moons is a fun challenge. The properties of Uranus are fascinating and confound the secularists but clearly declare God’s glory.12 References The other five planets known at the time were Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. Neither Neptune nor the dwarf planet Pluto had yet been discovered. The name was suggested by Johann Bode. Bode is known for his observation that the sequence of planet distances (in AU) from the sun can be approximated by a simple mathematical formula: a = 0.4 + 0.3×2n. This pattern is sometimes called Bode’s Law. The distance of Uranus matches the prediction of Bode’s Law. However, Neptune does not. Also, in Greek mythology Uranus was the father of Kronos—the Greek name for Saturn—just as in Roman mythology Saturn was the father of Jupiter. Voyager 2 is the only spacecraft to have visited Uranus. The color is caused by methane, which absorbs red light. Though imperceptible in visible wavelengths, belts and zones do appear in infrared images of Uranus. The astronomers who first detected Uranus’ rings were James Elliot, Edward Dunham, and Douglas Mink. The axial tilt of Uranus is usually reported either as 97.77° or 82.23°. The difference is due to ambiguity in which pole should be considered the North Pole. If the North Pole is considered to be the pole under which the planet rotates counterclockwise, then Uranus is tilted 97.77° and rotates prograde—in the same direction as Earth. If the North Pole is considered to be that which lies above the orbital plane, then Uranus is tilted 82.23° and rotates retrograde, i.e., “backward” from Earth. For six of the planets, there is no difference between the two conventions. Venus and Uranus are the exceptions.', ""What Is Orbital Tilt and How Do Astronomers Determine the Orbital Tilt of a Planet?

Since then, astronomers using Hubble and ground-based observatories have raised the total to 27 known moons, and spotting these was tricky — they are as little as 8 to 10 miles (12 to 16 km) across, blacker than asphalt and nearly 3 billion miles (4.8 billion km) away.

In addition to moons, Uranus may have a collection of Trojan asteroids — objects that share the same orbit as the planet — in a special region known as a Lagrange point .

Since then, we’ve had no opportunities to get new observations of this very unusual magnetosphere,” said Laurent Lamy, lead author of the team’s paper Earth-based detection of Uranus’ aurorae. Rather than rings of bright emissions, as witnessed on Earth as well as Saturn and Jupiter, the Uranian auroras appeared as bright spots of activity on the planet’s daytime side — most likely a result of Uranus’ peculiar orientation, as well as its seasonal alignment. It’s not yet known what may be happening on Uranus’ night side, which is out of view of Hubble. When Voyager 2 passed by Uranus in 1986 the planet was tipped such that its rotational axis was aimed toward the Sun. This meant that its magnetic axis — offset by 60 degrees — was angled enough to encounter the solar wind in much the same way that Earth’s does. This created nightside auroras similar to Earth’s that Voyager saw. By 2011, however, Uranus — which has an 84-year-long orbit — was near equinox and as a result its magnetic axis was nearly perpendicular with its orbital plane, aiming each end directly into the solar wind once a day. This makes for very different kinds of auroras than what was seen by Voyager; in fact, there’s really nothing else like it that astronomers know of.', 'Uranus: The Ringed Planet That Sits on its Side | Space [IE]>window.isIE = true<![endif] Skip to main content contentType : // xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?

Choi 2019-07-10T19:14:05Z Reference Article: Facts About Uranus Shares Uranus’ tilt essentially has the planet orbiting the Sun on its side, the axis of its spin is nearly pointing at the Sun. (Image: © NASA and Erich Karkoschka, U. of Arizona) Uranus is the seventh planet from the sun and the first to be discovered by scientists. Although Uranus is visible to the naked eye, it was long mistaken as a star because of the planet\'s dimness and slow orbit. The planet is also notable for its dramatic tilt, which causes its axis to point nearly directly at the sun. British astronomer William Herschel discovered Uranus on March 13, 1781, with his telescope while surveying all stars down to those about 10 times dimmer than can be seen by the naked eye. One star seemed different, and within a year Herschel realized the star followed a planetary orbit. Uranus (as it was called commonly after 1850 or so) was named after the Greek sky deity Ouranos, the earliest of the lords of the heavens. It is the only planet to be named after a Greek god rather than a Roman one. Before the name was settled on, many names had been proposed for the new planet, including Hypercronius (""above Saturn""), Minerva (the Roman goddess of wisdom) and Herschel, after its discoverer. To flatter King George III of England, Herschel proposed the name Georgium Sidus (""The Georgian Planet""), but the idea was unpopular outside England and King George\'s native Hanover, Germany. German astronomer Johann Bode, who detailed Uranus\' orbit, gave the planet its ultimate name. Bode argued that as Saturn was the father of Jupiter, the new planet should be named for the father of Saturn. [ Related: How Do You Pronounce \'Uranus\'? ] Physical characteristics Uranus is blue-green in color, as a result of the methane in its mostly hydrogen-helium atmosphere. The planet is often dubbed an ice giant, since at least 80% of its mass is a fluid mix of water, methane and ammonia ice. Unlike the other planets of the solar system, Uranus is tilted so far that it essentially orbits the sun on its side, with the axis of its spin nearly pointing at the star. This unusual orientation might be due to a collision with a planet-size body, or several small bodies, soon after it was formed. A 2018 study suggested the colliding world could have been twice the size of Earth . This unusual tilt gives rise to extreme seasons that last for about 20 years. This means that for nearly a quarter of the Uranian year, which is equal to 84 Earth-years, the sun shines directly over each pole, leaving the other half of the planet to experience a long, dark and frigid winter. Uranus has the coldest atmosphere of any of the planets in the solar system, even though it is not the most distant from the sun. That\'s because Uranus has little to no internal heat to supplement the heat from the sun. The magnetic poles of most planets are typically more or less lined up with the axis along which it rotates, but Uranus\' magnetic field is tilted, with its magnetic axis tipped nearly 60 degrees away from the planet\'s axis of rotation. This leads to a strangely lopsided magnetic field for Uranus, with the strength of the field at the northern hemisphere\'s surface being up to more than 10 times that of the strength at the southern hemisphere\'s surface. A 2017 study suggested the lopsided nature of Uranus\' magnetic field may also lead it to flicker on and off during every rotation (about every 17.24 hours). Uranus\' atmospheric composition by volume is 82.5% hydrogen, 15.2% helium and 2.3% methane. Its internal structure is made up of a mantle of water, ammonia and methane ices, as well as a core of iron and magnesium silicate. Uranus\' average distance from the sun is roughly 1.8 billion miles (2.9 billion km), according to NASA . That’s about 19 times the distance from the Earth to the sun. (Image credit: Karl Tate, SPACE.com) Uranus\' climate The extreme axial tilt Uranus experiences can give rise to unusual weather. As sunlight reaches some areas for the first time in years, it heats up the atmosphere, triggering gigantic springtime storms, according to NASA. However, when Voyager 2 first imaged Uranus in 1986 at the height of summer in its south, the spacecraft saw a bland-looking sphere with only about 10 or so visible clouds, leading to it to be dubbed ""the most boring planet,"" wrote astronomer Heidi Hammel in ""The Ice Giant Systems of Uranus and Neptune,"" a chapter in ""Solar System Update"" (Springer, 2007), a compilation of reviews in solar system science. It was decades later, when advanced telescopes such as Hubble came into play and Uranus\' long seasons changed, before scientists witnessed the extreme weather on Uranus. In 2014 , astronomers got their first glimpse at summer storms raging on Uranus. Strangely, these massive storms took place seven years after the planet reached its closest approach to the sun, and it remains a mystery why the giant storms occurred after the sun’s heating on the planet was at a maximum. Other unusual weather on Uranus includes diamond rain , which is thought to sink thousands of miles below the surface of icy giant planets such as Uranus and Neptune. Carbon and hydrogen are thought to compress under extreme heat and pressure deep in the atmospheres of these planets to form diamonds, which are then thought to sink downward, eventually settling around the cores of those worlds. Yes, Uranus has rings The rings of Uranus were the first to be seen after Saturn\'s. They were a significant discovery, because it helped astronomers understand that rings are a common feature of planets, not merely a peculiarity of Saturn. Uranus possesses two sets of rings. The inner system of rings consists mostly of narrow, dark rings, while an outer system of two more-distant rings, discovered by the Hubble Space Telescope, are brightly colored: one red, one blue. Scientists have identified 13 known rings around Uranus. A 2016 study suggested that the rings of Uranus, Saturn and Neptune may be the remnants of Pluto-like dwarf planets that strayed too close to the giant worlds long ago. These dwarf planets were torn apart in the planets’ vast gravities and are today preserved as rings. The Hubble Space Telescope observes Uranus every year. This view, in near infrared light, highlights not only the planet\'s rings but also atmospheric belts and clouds. (Image credit: NASA/JPL/STScI) Uranus also has moons Uranus has 27 known moons . Instead of being named after figures from Greek or Roman mythology, its first four moons were named after magical spirits in English literature, such as William Shakespeare\'s ""A Midsummer Night\'s Dream"" and Alexander Pope\'s ""The Rape of the Lock."" Since then, astronomers have continued this tradition, drawing names for the moons from the works of Shakespeare or Pope. Oberon and Titania are the largest Uranian moons, and were the first to be discovered, by Herschel in 1787. William Lassell, who was also the first to see a moon orbiting Neptune, discovered Uranus\' next two moons, Ariel and Umbriel. Nearly a century passed before Dutch-American astronomer Gerard Kuiper, he of Kuiper Belt fame, found Miranda in 1948. In 1986, Voyager 2 visited the Uranian system and discovered an additional 10 moons, all just 16 to 96 miles (26 to154 km) in diameter:Juliet, Puck, Cordelia, Ophelia, Bianca, Desdemona, Portia, Rosalind, Cressida and Belinda.

Everything is alive and conscious and interconnected. This in reality is how life is here on Earth, we are all connected by energy and we all have the ability to tap into the overarching consciousness and connect with each other. We are able to heal each other by tapping into and calling upon the divine. There are signs are all around us – in nature and in our own experiences that are meant to be read and interpreted, it is just learning to recognise those signs and learning how to use these to create our own lives. When I utilise distance healing I am using intention to tap into the greater consciousness and ask what it is you require to heal and intending that consciousness/love/all that is will heal you/show/provide you with what it is you need to heal. Distance healing can be seen as a form of healing energy that crosses time and space to have a healing effect on the person receiving the healing. As such the recipient doesn’t have to be physically present to receive the healing. As strange as it seems this type of healing is just as effective as an in person healing.

We get chemical energy from foods, which we use to run about, and move and talk (kinetic and sound energy). Chemical energies are stored in fuels which we burn to release thermal energy - this is one way of making electricity, see Electricity for more information. Nuclear - Nuclear energy is the energy stored inside tiny atoms. Atoms are invisible and make up the elements of the whole universe! There are three parts to these tiny particles which are - protons, electrons and neutrons. Nuclear energy is released when atoms are joined together (fusion) or split apart (fission). Doing this converts energy into thermal and radiant energy. The Sun uses nuclear energy to produce its light and heat. Converting Energy When we go for a run we are using chemical energy in our bodies to produce movement (kinetic energy), which in turn converts to warmth (thermal energy). Cycling downhill involves kinetic and gravitational energy. The friction between the tyres and the road will also cause the tyres to warm up a little producing thermal energy.

Along with basic thermodynamic data, coverage includes both dynamic and structural properties of phospholipid bilayers. It is an indispensable reference for users of bilayer model membranes and liposome delivery systems and for those interested in the biophysics of membrane structure. Each chapter in the second edition contains considerable amounts of explanation and elaboration, including, in many cases, extensive analysis of structural connections between the data.', 'Cell Membranes - Serious Science about videos talks FAQ people themes Work with us British Scientists astronomy biology chemistry linguistics mathematics media medicine physics psychology economics technology history Cell Membranes Molecular Biologist Richard Henderson on the lipid bilayer, mitochondria, and the evolution of organisms videos | December 12, 2016 0 Share Tweet The video is a part of the project British Scientists produced in collaboration between Serious Science and the British Council. Cell membranes are very important, they’ve been around for about 4 billion years, since the very first cells on Earth were developed, at the early stages of the evolution of life. The cells became more important, but the key characteristic of cells is that they’re surrounded by an envelope that seals them from the outside world. So the key function of the cell membrane is to separate the inside of the cell, which is controlled by life processes, from the outside of the cell, which is the environment. And then through time different functions of the cell membrane have evolved to give to cell the ability to cope in the big world. So for many years it wasn’t known what the cell membrane was made of other than that it’s a barrier between the inside and the outside of the cell. But about… probably about a hundred years ago from now originally Gorter and Grendal studied the red blood cell in the human body and extracted from the cell the fats, the lipids that are now known to be one component of the membrane. And they showed that there are enough lipid molecules in the membrane of a cell to make two complete layers covering the cell, and that was the origin of what was the original lipid bilayer theory of the cell, which is that it’s made up with largely lipid molecules which have a hydrophobic (that means “a water-repelling”) end to them and then a hydrophilic (a “water-loving”) end, so the hydrophobic is fat, and the hydrophilic is sugars and phosphates and things like that. So you have this molecule, the lipid, that has a hydrophobic and a hydrophilic end, and they pair together to form a bilayer. A lipid bilayer surrounds the cell. And for quite a while that was mostly what was known about the cell membrane.', 'Surface chemistry [ edit ] While lipid tails primarily modulate bilayer phase behavior, it is the headgroup that determines the bilayer surface chemistry. Most natural bilayers are composed primarily of phospholipids , but sphingolipids and sterols such as cholesterol are also important components. [24] Of the phospholipids, the most common headgroup is phosphatidylcholine (PC), accounting for about half the phospholipids in most mammalian cells. [25] PC is a zwitterionic headgroup, as it has a negative charge on the phosphate group and a positive charge on the amine but, because these local charges balance, no net charge. Other headgroups are also present to varying degrees and can include phosphatidylserine (PS) phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylglycerol (PG). These alternate headgroups often confer specific biological functionality that is highly context-dependent. For instance, PS presence on the extracellular membrane face of erythrocytes is a marker of cell apoptosis , [26] whereas PS in growth plate vesicles is necessary for the nucleation of hydroxyapatite crystals and subsequent bone mineralization. [27] [28] Unlike PC, some of the other headgroups carry a net charge, which can alter the electrostatic interactions of small molecules with the bilayer. [29] Biological roles [ edit ] Containment and separation [ edit ] The primary role of the lipid bilayer in biology is to separate aqueous compartments from their surroundings. Without some form of barrier delineating “self” from “non-self,” it is difficult to even define the concept of an organism or of life. This barrier takes the form of a lipid bilayer in all known life forms except for a few species of archaea that utilize a specially adapted lipid monolayer. [7] It has even been proposed that the very first form of life may have been a simple lipid vesicle with virtually its sole biosynthetic capability being the production of more phospholipids . [30] The partitioning ability of the lipid bilayer is based on the fact that hydrophilic molecules cannot easily cross the hydrophobic bilayer core, as discussed in Transport across the bilayer below. The nucleus, mitochondria and chloroplasts have two lipid bilayers, while other sub-cellular structures are surrounded by a single lipid bilayer (such as the plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticula, Golgi apparatus and lysosomes).

Jump to navigation Jump to search Parts of the cell The cell membrane is very important, because it works as a selective filter that allows only certain things to come inside or go outside the cell, it act as a body guard for our body.It can maintain a stable and healthy environment for cell in order to keep people healthy. plant cell membranes are rigid walls, and animal cell membranes are lipid bilayers. Plasma membrane bilayer The phospholipid bilayer which the cell membrane is an example of, is composed of various cholesterol, phospholipids , glycolipids, blagoscony and proteins. Below is an example of a simple phospholipid bilayer . The smaller molecules shown between the phospholipids are Cholesterol molecules. They help to provide rigidity or stability to the membrane. The two main components of phospholipids are shown in these figures by blue circles representing the hydrophilic head groups and by long thin lines representing the hydrophobic fatty acid tails. Both the interior of the cell and the area surrounding the cell is made up of water or similar aqueous solution. Consequently, phospholipids orient themselves with respect to the water and with each other so that the hydrophilic (""water loving"") head groups are grouped together and face the water, and the hydrophobic (""water fearing"") tails turn away from the water and toward each other. This self-organization of phospholipids results in one of just a few easily recognizable structures. Cell membranes are constructed of a phospholipid bilayer as shown above.']"

So far we have been the only small camper in all the campgrounds. Almost everyone has one those big class A buses towing a ""toad"" or large truck and huge campers. The Texans have taken it to a whole new level of BIG. What we have has been a dream to drive, park and be in so far. The space and style fits us, but ask me again after 54 days of having floor space that is really quite limited. I recall telling someone that it had everything but a dance floor, but a few nights ago we danced to Willie Nelson\'s CD Stardust Memories that we bought in a truck stop so now I can say that we can dance in it. We had a cold night in Las Cruces, NM where we were concerned about the Roadtrek’s water lines freezing. RVs have issues with water freezing in pipes just as houses do. If you have very cold weather and live in the northern states you have to do a complicated process of winterizing. It involves draining of all water and putting in a special anti freeze in the fresh water tanks. I don\'t like the idea of putting chemicals in the tank and then having to flush it out since people say you can taste it and I am concerned about the chemicals so we tried to avoid this process. We have one inside tank that is protected from frost, but we had problems with the water pump working correctly when we began the trip. We checked the weather and thought it was warm enough to get by but when we arrived at the RV park in New Mexico we found ice in the dog walking area at 4 pm. They had a notice up at the office to make sure not to leave the water hoses hooked up over night since they will freeze. It got down to 24 degrees overnight but we avoided any problems by keeping the inside at 69 degrees, bathroom door open and the hot water slightly dripping. I got up a few times to run both hot and cold so nothing froze. This is the coldest spot so we should be fine after this.

What are the different types of weathering? There are four main types of weathering. These are freeze-thaw, onion skin (exfoliation), chemical and biological weathering. Freeze-Thaw Most rocks are very hard. However, a very small amount of water can cause them to break. When water seeps into cracks and freezes it then expands. This powerful force can increase the size of cracks. Over time the repeated freeze-thaw action of water can break rocks apart. Eventually, pieces of rock break off creating scree. The image below shows the impact of freeze thaw on a rock in Iceland. source Exfoliation or Onion Skin Weathering This type of erosion is common in warm areas. As the sun shines on rocks during the day it causes them to expand. During the night the rock contracts due to the colder temperature. Over time this continued process causes small pieces of surface rock to flake off."", 'Geology Jobs Home Geology What is Weathering? What Are Types Of Weathering?

Weathering is breaking down rocks, soil, and minerals as well as wood and artificial materials by contacting the atmosphere, water, and biological organisms of the Earth. Weathering takes place in situ, i.e. in the same place, with little or no movement. It should therefore not be confused with erosion involving the movement of rocks and minerals by agents such as water, ice, snow, wind, waves and gravity, and then transported and deposited elsewhere. There are two important weathering process classifications–physical and chemical weathering; each involves a biological component at times. Mechanical or physical weathering involves rock and soil breakdown by direct contact with atmospheric conditions such as heat, water, ice and pressure. The second classification, chemical weathering, involves the direct effect in the breakdown of rocks, soils and minerals of atmospheric chemicals or biologically produced chemicals also known as biological weathering. While physical weathering is emphasized in very cold or very dry environments, where the climate is wet and hot, chemical reactions are most intense. Both types of weathering, however, take place together, and each tends to speed up the other.', 'Growing roots of plants can put stress or pressure on rock. Even though the process is physical, a biological process (i.e. growing roots) exerts the pressure. Biological processes can also produce chemical weathering, such as when organic acids are produced by plant roots or microorganisms that help dissolve minerals. Microbial activity breaks down rock minerals by altering the chemical composition of the rock, making it more weather sensitive. One example of microbial activity is lichen ; lichen is a symbiotic relationship between fungi and algae. Fungi release chemical substances that break down rock minerals ; the algae consume the minerals thus released from rock. Holes and gaps continue to develop on the rock as this process continues, exposing the rock to physical and chemical weathering. Burrowing animals can move fragments of rock to the surface, exposing the rock to more intense chemical, physical, and biological processes, thereby indirectly enhancing the weathering process. How Weathering Is Different From Erosion? The main difference between weathering and erosion is that there is weathering whereas erosion involves moving to a new location. Both are caused by wind, water, ice, temperature, and even biological action similar factors. They can also take place together.

Cheremisinoff Ph.D., in Groundwater Remediation and Treatment Technologies , 1997 Chemical Weathering Chemical weathering , on the other hand, is an actual change in composition as minerals are modified from one type to another. Many, if not most of the changes are accompanied by a volumetric increase or decrease, which in itself further promotes additional chemical weathering. The rate depends on temperature, surface area, and available water. The major reactions involved in chemical weathering are oxidation, hydrolysis, and carbonation. Oxidation is a reaction with oxygen to form an oxide, hydrolysis is reaction with water, and carbonation is a reaction with CO 2 to form a carbonate. In these reactions the total volume increases and, since chemical weathering is most effective on grain surfaces, disintegration of a rock occurs. Quartz, whether vein deposits or individual grains, undergoes practically no chemical weathering; the end product is quartz sand. Some of the feldspars weather to clay and release calcium, sodium, silica, and many other elements that are transported in water. The iron-bearing minerals provide, in addition to iron and magnesium, weathering products that are similar to the feldspars.

Gaillardet, in Treatise on Geochemistry , 2007 5.20.1 Introduction Chemical weathering of rocks is a spontaneous (i.e., irreversible) thermodynamic process leading to a more stable state for natural materials under a given set of conditions (e.g., temperature and pressure). It results from the reaction of aqueous, acidic, and oxidizing solutions with the minerals in rocks and soils. Chemical weathering studies are of fundamental importance for several reasons: • Chemical weathering of continental rocks is the major chemical process by which soils are generated. Soils constitute a fundamental reservoir of (macro- and micro-) nutrients essential for the normal healthy growth of living organisms (plants, animals, and humans at the end of the food chain). Chemical weathering controls the formation and evolution of soil, particularly (1) the concentration and distribution of chemical elements in the soil including the elements that control soil fertility and (2) the physical properties of the soil ( Nahon, 1991 ). This is particularly important for nutrient deficient soils of tropical countries, which represent one-third of the continental surface, constitute huge fresh water reservoirs, and where 50% of the world population is living ( Tardy, 1993 ). This is illustrated in Figure 1 , which is a comparison of the chemical composition (sodium (Na), magnesium (Mg), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), silicon (Si), aluminium (Al), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), and titanium (Ti)) of some nutrient-depleted Amazonian soils with that of an agricultural soil from California (San Joaquin soil, NIST, USA). Chemical weathering is a key process in the cycle of the elements at the Earth’s surface. Within the different reservoirs (continent, ocean, and atmosphere) chemical weathering is the major source of elements delivered by rivers to the oceans ( Martin and Whitfield, 1983 ). A consequence of the processes considered above is that chemical weathering contributes to denudation, the lowering of land surface by removal of material, and controls landscape development ( Milliman and Meade, 1983 ; Walling and Fang, 2003 ). Understanding the rates of chemical weathering for watersheds located all around the world is fundamental for soil resource management. Figure 1 . Chemical composition of different Amazonian soils ( Kronberg and Fyfe, 1983 ). Concentrations have been normalized to an estimate of the chemical composition of the upper continental crust ( Taylor and McLennan, 1985 ). For comparison the chemical composition of an agricultural soil from the United States of America (San Joaquin soil, Standard Reference Material, NIST, USA) is also given. • Chemical weathering is also strongly linked to climate because chemical weathering of silicate rock consumes CO 2 and over geological time has played a key role in climate regulation. Chemical weathering rates (CWR) of silicates (1) and carbonates (2) on the continents and carbonate precipitation (3) in the oceans can be represented by the following reactions: (1) CaAl 2 Si 2 O 8 s + 2 CO 2 g + 3 H 2 O aq = Ca 2 + aq + 2 HCO 3 − aq + Al 2 Si 2 O 5 OH 4 s (2) CaCO 3 s + H 2 O aq + CO 2 g = Ca 2 + aq + 2 HCO 3 − aq (3) Ca 2 + aq + 2 HCO 3 − aq = CaCO 3 s + H 2 O aq + CO 2 g Examination of these three reactions reveals that dissolution of carbonates has no net effect on the CO 2 balance of the atmosphere because 1 mol of CO 2 is consumed for the dissolution of one mole of CaCO 3 , while 1 mol is released during the precipitation of CaCO 3 in the oceans. More precisely, carbonate dissolution will have an effect on the CO 2 balance of the atmosphere only on a timescale that is similar to or shorter than the residence time of HCO 3 − in the oceans (100,000 years). On longer timescales, limestone weathering and limestone deposition will cancel each other out. By contrast, the dissolution of 1 mol of CaAl 2 Si 2 O 8 will consume 2 mol of CO 2 . If Ca is then deposited as limestone in the ocean, only 1 mol of CO 2 is returned to the atmosphere. Thus, silicate weathering results in a net consumption of CO 2 . Other processes may consume CO 2 (exchange between Na, K, and Ca from the particle surface in seawater) or release CO 2 (precipitation of secondary silicates in seawater) but are still poorly understood and badly quantified (see Chapter 6.11 ). Even though there is still some debate in the scientific community, authors generally consider that increased rock weathering 300–400 Ma caused a decrease in the atmospheric concentration of CO 2 ( Knoll and James, 1987 ; Berner, 1992, 1994 ). All existing numerical models describing the evolution of global biogeochemical cycles at the geological timescale are based on the work by Walker et al. (1981) . These authors argue for a direct dependency of continental silicate weathering on climate (silicate weathering increases with temperature and runoff, both enhanced under higher P CO 2 values). At the geological scale (10 6 –10 9 years), the main factors driving the climate, in close connection with silicate weathering, are the solar constant, CO 2 degassing rate, and continental configuration. Walker et al. (1981) proposed a law (model) to link quantitatively global mean temperature, CO 2 degassing rate, and CO 2 consumption by continental weathering. In this model, the rate of continental weathering was controlled by temperature and runoff. Another model was proposed by Raymo (1991) in which chemical weathering was not controlled by temperature but by tectonic effects. Orogenesis induces a lowering of atmospheric CO 2 pressure through chemical weathering processes. This leads to lower temperatures that create glaciated environments, again increasing erosional processes. However, this hypothesis leads to the existence of long-term disequilibria between the CO 2 outgassing and the consumption by continental silicate weathering. However, several questions arise from these models. Is continental weathering controlled only by temperature and runoff at the global scale? Is it possible to reconstruct the relationship between temperature, runoff, and the partial pressure of CO 2 in the atmosphere? What is the role of physical erosion? Is it possible to establish general laws from field observations? There is no doubt that the increasing number of studies dealing with chemical weathering during recent decades is related to increasing concern about global climate change. This chapter will consider these questions. The objective is to estimate CWRs of silicates, and to define which parameters control these rates at a global scale on the basis of the chemical composition of rivers draining both small and large watersheds. The importance of parameters controlling CWRs should be evaluated and included in climate models ( Dupré et al. , 2003 ).

Trenhaile, in Reference Module in Earth Systems and Environmental Sciences , 2016 Chemical weathering Chemical weathering is promoted on rock coasts by alternate immersion and exposure in the intertidal zone and by spray and splash in the supratidal zone ( Fig. 3c ). Coastal zones therefore provide the water that is needed for chemical reactions and the runoff to remove the soluble products. Chemical weathering reduces rock hardness and it is particularly important along discontinuities, which facilitates wave quarrying, and in hot, wet climates where cliff retreat may largely result from the removal of fine-grained, weathered material by fairly weak waves. Chemical and salt weathering can produce tafoni ( Fig. 3d ) and honeycombs, and they make important contributions to water-layer leveling, a suite of processes operating around the edges of pools of standing water that lowers, smoothes, and levels shore platform surfaces ( Bartrum and Turner, 1928 ). Chemical weathering can result in case hardening, or strengthening, of rock surfaces with silica, iron, and other cementing agents from evaporating saline solutions, and chemically weathered softening or rotting of the rock interior ( Fig. 3d ). Frame weathering, which often occurs in conjunction with water-layer leveling, results from the movement of dissolved ions along joint planes, which can deplete or impregnate them with precipitates. If impregnated joints become more resistant than the joint blocks, then weathering pits with raised rims develop, whereas if the joints are weaker, small plateaus can be produced, sometimes in a form reminiscent of miniature volcanoes.

Catuneanu, in Developments in Precambrian Geology , 2004 Relative Rates of Chemical Weathering and Mechanical Erosion Where chemical weathering rates are much more rapid than rates of erosion, profiles are well developed, with the exposed surface being composed primarily of aluminous, secondary clay minerals and quartz ( Figs. 5.10-3a , 5.10-4a). If mechanical erosion is commensurate with the rate of chemical weathering ( Fig. 5.10-4b ), the weathered mantle capping source rock will be less well developed and the exposed surface will be composed of both clay minerals (with complex clays, smectites, illites, vermiculites dominating kaolinite and gibbsite) and primary minerals. Where the rate of mechanical erosion greatly dominates over the rate of chemical weathering ( Fig. 5.10-4c ) a disaggregated weathering profile may be very thin or absent and primary bedrock may constitute much of the exposed surface. Any detritus derived from the exposed surfaces is composed mostly of primary minerals (with minor complex clays). Although derived from the same bedrock source, the composition of detritus derived from each of these hypothetical profiles would differ greatly, the differences being due solely to the relative rates of chemical weathering and mechanical erosion. Fig. 5.10-4 . Hypothetical, idealised profiles with illustration of the relative intensities of chemical weathering and mechanical erosion required to produce a profile with the properties shown.

Nasim Mohammadzadeh, in Chemostratigraphy , 2015 5.4.8 Source-Area Weathering Chemical weathering largely affects the composition of siliciclastic sediments. Through these processes, the large cations (e.g., Ba and Al) remain preserved in the weathering residue in contrast to the smaller cations (Na, Ca, and Sr) that can be selectively removed ( Fedo et al., 1996; Nath et al., 2000 ). The degree of weathering may be assessed by the chemical index of alteration, commonly referred as CIA ( Nesbitt and Young, 1982 ). According to the methods of McLennan (1993) , we calculated the CIA for the samples under study. The CIA values of approximately 50 indicate simply an unweathered upper crust or weak weathering, whereas CIA values of 100 indicate intense weathering with a complete removal of alkali and alkaline earth elements and an increase in Al 2 O 3 ( McLennan, 1993; Dupuis et al., 2006; Fedo et al., 1996 ). The calculated CIA values of sandstone samples range from 53.8 to 65.8, with an average of 60.11 ( Table 2 ). However, all of the samples have values greater than 50, suggesting low to moderate weathering. In addition, occurrences of lowest CIA values in the lower part of the formation and relatively higher CIA values in the upper part are observed, suggestive of initiation of the deposition of the Aghajari Formation immediately after major tectonic movement in the provenance as a result of which only mechanical weathering prevailed, which gradually changed to chemical weathering over time.

Bleam, in Soil and Environmental Chemistry , 2012 Abstract: Chemical weathering in the rock cycle produces a variety of secondary minerals, some of which are chemically active mineral colloids. This chapter examines the crystal structure and physical behavior of one mineral group: clay minerals. Clay minerals—also known as layer silicates or phyllosilicates—derive their unique chemical and physical behavior from their crystal structure. Clay mineralogy discusses phyllosilicate crystal structures using the polyhedral model widely used by mineralogists. Clay chemistry examines the relationship among cation substitution, layer charge, and interlayer cations. Certain clay minerals swell when exposed to liquid or vapor water—behavior that depends on the magnitude and location of the layer charge, the hydration properties of the interlayer cations, and the osmotic pressure of water in contact with the clay mineral.

Haldar, Josip Tišljar, in Introduction to Mineralogy and Petrology , 2014 5.5.6 Residual Sediments: Laterite, Kaolin, Bauxite and Terra Rossa Chemical weathering of some rocks (as is more fully explained in Section 5.2.1.2 ) creates three groups of products of weathering: 1. Ions in the dissolved state: mainly released from rocks and hydrated alkali and alkaline earth elements (Na, K, Li, Ca, Mg, and Sr) and silicon in the form of silicic acid (H 4 SiO 4 ). 2. Authigenic minerals: particularly clay minerals (kaolinite and seladonite or montmorillonite) and aluminum hydroxides. 3. Residues or waste of the rocks that in the spending did not dissolve (usually those containing quartz and resistant silicate minerals, especially mica). The second and third groups are residual sediments or residues. In the initial stage of chemical weathering of mafic, neutral and ultramafic igneous rocks rich in olivine, pyroxene and amphibole, form authigenic minerals from group of chlorite and clay rich in iron and magnesium. Kaolinite, smectite and illite-clay are weathered products of acid igneous rocks and feldspar-rich granite-gneisses. In the advance stages of weathering, the clay is partially washed out in the form of colloidal particles, and also remains in the form of residual deposits. All magnesium and calcium minerals are leached out if the process continues uninterrupted. Quartz is the only left over or the final product or residue from primary mineral composition of rocks and newly formed authigenic minerals of the kaolinite group, boehmite, gibbsite, limonite and hematite. Strong chemical weathering, hot and humid air, and little or practically no erosion or removal of products of wear is necessary for the origin of such residue. This procedure generates residual sediments of laterite type, which are often economically significant mineral resources. The most important residual sediments petrologically include laterite, residual clay or kaolin, terra rossa (or “red soil”, weathering of limestone) and bauxite. Laterite soils are reddish-brown color ( Fig. 5.41 ), which are products of strong chemical weathering of mafic and ultramafic rocks rich in olivine, pyroxene and hornblende. Laterite is rich in iron hydroxides, nickel, copper, chromium, platinum–palladium and aluminum, to which also contains small amounts of humus, quartz, calcite, clay and other minerals. Laterites are widely distributed and best developed on large plains made of basalt and basic intrusive ultramafic rocks in areas with humid tropical climate and low relief (India, Africa, and South America) with weak erosion. Laterite can be a potential source of high-value metallic minerals. FIGURE 5.41 . Laterite soil (deep red brown color), chemical residual product from layered ultramafic complex, contains rich nickel resource from upper levels of Sukinda chromite deposits/mines, Orissa, India. Source: Ref. 25 . Kaolin or China clay is residual sediment consisting of pure kaolinite ( Fig. 2.16 ), i.e. clay minerals from a group of hydrated aluminosilicates Al 2 Si 2 O 5 (OH) 4 , as a residual product of chemical weathering of feldspar, mainly from granite rocks. Kaolin deposits are usually formed by deposition of kaolinite after its shorter transfer by water from the point of spending or granite gneiss, mostly in lacustrine environments. Kaolin layers are typically located along the lake sands, sludges and coal or peat. Kaolin is a valuable mineral raw material for the manufacture of ceramics, especially porcelain, and the raw material in paper production. Red Mediterranean soil , also known as terra rossa (Italian for “red soil”), is a soil classification that has been formally superseded by the formal classifications of systems such as the FAO soil classification, but that is still in common use. FAO stands for “Food and Agriculture Organization” of the United Nations. Red soil (terra rossa) is, in geological terms, fine-grain sediment reddish brown and yellowish-red color, which is as clay-dusty cultivable soil located on calcareous, karst terrain of the Mediterranean area. Terra rossa is the chemical weathering product of limestone under oxidizing conditions excelled by Mediterranean climate. The distinctiveness of red soil is its red color due to soil processes peptization of amorphous iron hydroxide and the formation of tiny crystals of hematite and goethite in tiny, dense ground mass of soil. With respect to granulation of red soils belongs to the fine-grained pelite sediments, because they consist of particle size <63 mm and very small, often insignificant share of the fine sand. Mineral composition of terra rossa is usually as follows: dominant are mica minerals (mica and illite), quartz and clay minerals (kaolinite and disordered kaolinite), and the much smaller proportion of hematite and goethite as well as amorphous substances, plagioclase and K-feldspar. Red polygenetic soils mainly derived from powder materials that cover on the limestone and dolomite surface applied by wind, and by precipitation in cavities during heavy rains. It is often mixed with a small amount of indigenous soil generated from weathering of carbonate substrates. It also results in prolonged and repeated process of resedimentation. The origin (pedogenesis or soil evolution) is essential Mediterranean climate, good permeability carbonate base for a strong drainage, pH around 7 (roughly neutral) of pore solution, strong carbonate leaching, long-term (>10,000 years) suitable conditions for the formation of hematite and goethite as well as long (>10,000 years) suitable conditions for the genesis of kaolinite and generally accumulation of clay minerals. Bauxites are rocks that contain minerals mostly from the group of aluminum hydroxide, mainly gibbsite (Al(OH) 3 ) or aluminum oxide hydrate boehmite (AlOOH) and rarely amorphous gel (Al(OH) 3 ). In addition to aluminum and bauxite minerals regularly contain variable amounts of kaolinite and halloysite, quartz, aluminum chlorite, hematite and goethite, and as the minor ingredients rutile and anatase. Bauxites are used for obtaining aluminum ore and also as refractory bricks. Bauxites arise in two mutually substantially different geological conditions: 1. the intensive chemical consumed silicate rocks of igneous and metamorphic origin to transform so-called laterite bauxites or silicate bauxites, and 2. karst on carbonate rocks, and are known as karst bauxites or carbonate bauxites . Laterite bauxites are typical of tropical regions of South America, West Africa, India and Australia, and the massifs of Arkansas (USA). Karst bauxites are very abundant in the Mediterranean region, the Urals, West-Indian islands and in East Asia. The process of formation of aluminum hydroxide in bauxite is associated with the hydrolysis of clay minerals, mainly kaolinite. For such a process requires underlying material, mainly clay minerals and large amounts of water to remove the silicon in the form of silicic acid, which requires a long geological time. Previously, it was thought that the karst bauxites occur by hydration process of clay material that is exclusively insoluble left over of karst and exposed to emersion limestone and dolomite. In recent times, there is more evidence that the parent material for the origin of karst bauxite may largely derive from small material Aeolian origin, therefore, of fine-grained materials or powders were either terrigenic or volcanic origin issued by wind, and only part of the insoluble residue of limestone and dolomite.

This representation neglects crystal structure distinctions, since crystal structure has a relatively minor effect when considering the global impact of chemical weathering on acid-base chemistry. Table 7.3 lists the oxide mole-per-mass fraction composition of Earth's crust. A detailed discussion of how the composition of rocks or minerals is converted from a mass fraction representation to a sum of oxides representation appears in Appendix 7B . Table 7.3 . Oxide Mole-per-Mass Composition of Earth's Crust Oxide Mole-per-Mass Fraction, mol ⋅ k g − 1 Si O 2 ( s ) 9.68 A l 2 O 3 ( s ) 1.54 F e O ( s ) 1.11 C a O ( s ) 1.16 N a 2 O ( s ) 0.49 M g O ( s ) 1.14 K 2 O ( s ) 0.24 Source: Greenwood and Earnshaw, 1997 . The formal oxidation state of iron in the crust is F e ( I I ) , but chemical weathering occurs under oxidizing conditions, favoring the oxidation of F e ( I I ) to F e ( I I I ) . Environmental acid-base chemistry is indifferent to this oxidation reaction: (7.22) 2 ⋅ F e O ( s ) + 1 2 ⋅ O 2 ( g ) → F e 2 O 3 ( s ) The Jackson clay mineral weathering sequence (see Table 3.2 ) lists aluminum, iron, and titanium oxides in the final stages of the mineral weathering sequence. The oxides A l 2 O 3 ( s ) and F e 2 O 3 ( s ) behave as inert substances in the reaction depicting the chemical weathering of Earth's silicate crust. The only reactive substances in the reaction depicting the chemical weathering of Earth's silicate crust (expression ( 7.23 )) are the alkali and alkaline earth oxides and Si O 2 ( s ) : (7.23) 9.68 ⋅ Si O 2 ( s ) + 1.54 ⋅ A l 2 O 3 ( s ) + 0.56 ⋅ F e 2 O 3 ( s ) + 1.16 ⋅ C a O ( s ) + 1.14 ⋅ M g O ( s ) + 0.49 ⋅ N a 2 O ( s ) + 0.24 ⋅ K 2 O ( s ) + 6.06 ⋅ H 2 O ( l ) → dissolution 9.68 ⋅ Si O 2 ( aq ) + 1.54 ⋅ A l 2 O 3 ( s ) + 0.56 ⋅ F e 2 O 3 ( s ) + 1.16 ⋅ C a 2 + ( aq ) + 1.14 ⋅ M g 2 + ( aq ) + 0.99 ⋅ N a + ( aq ) + 0.47 ⋅ K + ( aq ) + 6.06 ⋅ H O − ( aq ) Geochemists typically represent aqueous silicic acid H 4 Si O 4 ( aq ) as Si O 2 ( aq ) . Adding two moles of water to the left-hand side of Eq. (7.23) for each mole of Si O 2 ( s ) and replacing Si O 2 ( aq ) with H 4 Si O 4 ( aq ) on the right-hand side, while more accurate chemically, has essentially no impact on environmental acid-base chemistry. The acid-base significance of the chemical weathering of Earth's silicate crust (7.23) is the dissolution of the alkali and alkaline earth oxides. Charge neutrality demands one mole of H O − ( aq ) on the right-hand side of Eq. (7.23) —and one-half mole of H 2 O ( l ) on the left-hand side—for every mole of solute charge: (7.24) C a O ( s ) + H 2 O ( l ) → dissolution C a 2 + ( aq ) + 2 ⋅ H O − ( aq ) Based on the criteria chemists use to distinguish strong and weak bases, both C a O ( s ) and M g O ( s ) are considered weak bases, but recognizing the qualitative nature of this distinction, we consider all alkali and alkaline earth oxides in the chemical weathering reaction (7.23) and Table 7.3 as strong bases. Clearly, the chemical weathering of silicate rocks (7.23) is a source of strong bases in natural waters. Natural waters at the Earth surface absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Two processes cause C O 2 ( aq ) to dissolve in natural waters: the inherent water solubility of C O 2 ( aq ) ( Eq. (7.25) ) and the acid-base neutralization reaction ( Eq. (7.26) ) involving aqueous carbon dioxide and hydroxyl ions, the latter resulting from the chemical weathering of silicate minerals ( Eq. (7.23) ). (7.25) C O 2 ( g ) → dissolution C O 2 ( aq ) (7.26) C O 2 ( aq ) weak acid + H O − ( aq ) strong base → neutralization H C O 3 − ( aq ) conjugate base Taking into account acid-base reaction (7.26), the chemical weathering of silicate minerals (7.23) can be reformulated as the following—neglecting the inert oxides A l 2 O 3 ( s ) and F e 2 O 3 ( s ) : (7.27) 9.68 ⋅ Si O 2 ( s ) + 3.03 ⋅ H 2 O ( l ) + 6.06 ⋅ C O 2 ( g ) + 1.16 ⋅ C a O ( s ) + 1.14 ⋅ M g O ( s ) + 0.49 ⋅ N a 2 O ( s ) + 0.24 ⋅ K 2 O ( s ) → dissolution 9.68 ⋅ Si O 2 ( aq ) + 6.06 ⋅ H C O 3 − ( aq ) + 1.16 ⋅ C a 2 + ( aq ) + 1.14 ⋅ M g 2 + ( aq ) + 0.99 ⋅ N a + ( aq ) + 0.47 ⋅ K + ( aq ) Garrels and Mackenzie (1971) observe that an estimate of solution bicarbonate derived from the chemical weathering of silicate rocks “can be achieved if it is assumed that, on the average, silicate minerals produce one bicarbonate ion and two silica ions for each molecule of carbon dioxide”: (7.28) silicate rocks : C H C O 3 − ≈ C Si O 2 ( aq ) 2 The Garrels-Mackenzie estimate of bicarbonate resulting from the chemical weathering of silicate minerals derives from the composition of Earth's crust (see Table 7.3 ) and the chemical weathering of silicate minerals ( Eq.

Treiman, in Volatiles in the Martian Crust , 2019 5.5 Past Atmospheric p CO 2 and Environmental Conditions Chemical weathering is most rapid when atmospheric CO 2 pressures are large. Thus, carbonate abundance is one of the key factors in constraining past p CO 2 . Manning et al. (2006) modeled past Martian p CO 2 as a function of atmospheric, ice cap, adsorbed CO 2 in the regolith, and carbonate-rich reservoirs. We can calculate the equivalent p CO 2 trapped as carbonate in order to constrain the thick and thin models for the ancient atmosphere described by Manning et al. (2006) . If we assume a crustal density of 3000 kg/m 3 , 1000 m of crust, with 1 wt% CaCO 3 , would contain 2.2 × 10 18 kg of carbonate (= 2.2×10 19 mol CO 2 ). Every 1 wt% of CaCO 3 , if assumed to be evenly distributed within the top 1000 m of Martian crust, is equivalent to 37,000 Pa (370 mbar) of trapped p CO 2 ( Bridges et al., 2001 ). The Martian crustal abundances, up to 4.5 wt% at the Phoenix site—and higher at Spirit-Comache—are equivalent to at least 170,000 Pa p CO 2 (1.7 bar) if they are representative of the Martian crust. The lesser abundances detected at Gale crater suggest that it is an upper limit to a crustal average; however, it is clear that the Mars crust has an inventory of at least hundreds of mbar CO 2 . The thick atmospheric model of Manning et al. (2006) includes a 450-mbar carbonate reservoir, while thin models have 200 mbar. The recent surface and meteorite carbonate analyses summarized here suggest that a thick atmospheric model is the more accurate scenario. This predicts an early free inventory of 5 bar and that 300–700 mbar of free CO 2 remained by the late-Noachian. Thick models also imply a relatively large current CO 2 ice cap. Such models are consistent with recent MAVEN measurements of atmospheric loss rates ( Jakosky et al., 2017 ). The sublimation of a massive cap at a high obliquity would create a climate swing with the likelihood of greenhouse warming effects on the Martian surface as atmospheric pressure exceeds the triple point of water.

Henri Spaltenstein, in International Geophysics , 2000 8.2.2 Chemical Weathering Chemical weathering involves chemical changes of rocks and minerals under near-surface conditions. Mineral grains in soils (see Table 8-1 ) are bathed in a film of water and the dissolution of these minerals depends on a number of factors. First, the solubility of the mineral affects the potential of a mineral to be weathered; this is determined largely by the number and strength of chemical bonds within the crystal lattice. Second, temperature affects the rate of weathering reactions. Third, the composition of the soil solution surrounding the mineral grains will determine weathering rates; solution pH, organic acids, carbonic acid, concentration of other ions already in solution, redox, and complexing ligands can all affect how readily the ions released by weathering can go into solution. And last, water; water is not only the universal solvent in the weathering environment, but it is also the vehicle for the redistribution of products of weathering. The amount of contact between the soil solution and the mineral surface in conjunction with the frequency of removal of soil solution containing ions released by weathering (and its replacement with new soil solution) will all determine how readily a mineral weathers. Taking these factors into consideration it is possible to determine the thermodynamic stability of minerals, and predict the weathering sequence of minerals in an environment ( Garrels and Christ, 1965 ). There are six fundamental processes that chemically weather minerals. These are dissolution, hydration, hydrolysis, acidolysis, chelation , and oxidation/reduction. Table 8-1 .

21,5,Does weathering change the composition of rocks?,"['http://www.geologypage.com/2016/05/weathering.html_p3', 'http://www.geologypage.com/2016/05/weathering.html_p4']","[""Chemical Weathering Chemical weathering changes rock composition, often transforming them into different chemical reactions when water interacts with minerals. Chemical weathering is a gradual and ongoing process as the rock mineralogy adjusts to the environment near the surface. The rock’s original minerals develop new or secondary minerals. The oxidation and hydrolysis processes are most important in this. Chemical weathering is enhanced by geological agents such as water and oxygen, as well as biological agents such as microbial and plant-root metabolism acids. Where does Chemical Weathering occur? These chemical processes require water and occur faster at higher temperatures, so it is best to have warm, humid climates. The first stage in soil production is chemical weathering (especially hydrolysis and oxidation). Recommended For You Salty Water and Gas Sucked Into Earth's Interior Helps Unravel Planetary Evolution How does Chemical Weathering occur? There are various types of chemical weathering, the most important of which is: Solution Removal of rock by acidic rainwater in solution. In particular, dissolved CO2-containing rainwater (this process is sometimes referred to as carbonation) weathers calestone. Hydrolysis Acidic water breakdown of rock producing clay and soluble salts. Oxidation Rock breakdown by oxygen and water, often giving a rusty – colored weathered surface to iron – rich rocks. Biological Weathering Biological weathering is the weakening and subsequent breakdown by plants, animals and microbes of rock."", 'Growing roots of plants can put stress or pressure on rock. Even though the process is physical, a biological process (i.e. growing roots) exerts the pressure. Biological processes can also produce chemical weathering, such as when organic acids are produced by plant roots or microorganisms that help dissolve minerals. Microbial activity breaks down rock minerals by altering the chemical composition of the rock, making it more weather sensitive. One example of microbial activity is lichen ; lichen is a symbiotic relationship between fungi and algae. Fungi release chemical substances that break down rock minerals ; the algae consume the minerals thus released from rock. Holes and gaps continue to develop on the rock as this process continues, exposing the rock to physical and chemical weathering. Burrowing animals can move fragments of rock to the surface, exposing the rock to more intense chemical, physical, and biological processes, thereby indirectly enhancing the weathering process. How Weathering Is Different From Erosion? The main difference between weathering and erosion is that there is weathering whereas erosion involves moving to a new location. Both are caused by wind, water, ice, temperature, and even biological action similar factors. They can also take place together.

Go back and look at that Chicago Tribune article and you’ll see the following also attributed to Madhur Jaffrey: “No Indian uses commercial curry powder, she insists, nor do Indian cooks mix their own, because they use a different blend of spices for each recipe and insist on freshly ground spices instead of a bottled mixture that is powdered and possibly stale”. There is so much that is just wrong here. The only way I can account for someone as astute as Jaffrey believing any of this is her class background and the fact that India stopped being her primary home in the 1950s. I’d guess/pretty much know that Jaffrey grew up in a home with many servants and many cooks in the kitchen. For Indians in the middle class and below this is just not true. Middle class Indians may have cooks or maids coming in who prepare meals but this idea that all spices are being freshly ground in the homes of working women is a fantasy. That it is a fantasy can be seen quite simply just by walking into any Indian grocery store—in India or the diaspora—and seeing the vast variety of packaged pre-ground spices and spice mixes on offer. From a particular class position or privileged relationship to cooking the use of such spices may seem like a sort of fall from grace but it’s just the reality of most Indians. By and large the only urban kitchens in which all/most spices are ground freshly are those of hobbyists, the rich, or ones in homes where free domestic labour is available (usually from women).', 'Understand Your Clients If you’re going to earn and retain clients, you need to understand where they’re coming from.

I had put together a meal plan for the week and this was a recipe I had wanted to make because it had some amazing spices in the rub and the maple glaze sounded pretty good... a nice contrast that should please everyone. The rub has a combination of paprika, salt, cumin, black pepper and cinnamon. I thought this was a great starting point for our dinner. I love when a variety of spices come together to make something delicious... it kind of justifies my trips to Penzey\'s! The only problem with the original recipe was that the maple glaze didn\'t come together for me. It could have just been an off night or something. So, rather than use something that just didn\'t seem to be working, I opted to use a combination of our favorite bbq sauce and some honey to glaze the chicken.

Turmeric, a relative of the ginger root, is known for its anti-inflammatory properties, and for being a flavour and colour additive in curries. It has been used in India for thousands of years as a spice and medicinal herb. Research has shown that it contains compounds with medicinal properties, the most important of which is curcumin, the main active ingredient in turmeric. Preliminary studies found that curcuminoids from turmeric may reduce the number of heart attacks patients have after bypass surgery. Turmeric is also used as a dietary supplement to treat inflammatory arthritis, as well as stomach, skin, liver and gall bladder problems. Remember: While there are health benefits in the spices added to popular Indian cuisine, these foods, especially festive snacks, may also be high in sugar or fat content.

So why not look into some less expensive food and herbal non-toxic solutions to ease the pain? Helpful Herbs Turmeric – Turmeric has been clinically tested for its anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties extensively over the past couple of decades, even earning kudos from within the medical establishment. The spice also matches or surpasses OTC and prescribed medications for handling arthritic inflammation. This herb is used mostly as a spice with food, but the best way to consume turmeric easily on a daily basis and get the most bio-available form of its active ingredient, curcumin, is mixing it with fats like coconut oil or milk and heating. Add some pepper to increase bio-availability. To ensure the stomach’s acids don’t interfere with small intestinal absorption, the capsules (if you’re taking it in pill form) should be enteric coated. They should also contain pepperine, pepper’s active ingredient that enhances absorption. Curcumin, the active compound in the spice, is what makes turmeric so powerful for healing and disease prevention. Ginger – For many individuals, ginger can be just as effective as ibuprofen for only without the nasty side-effects. It also relieves upset or queasy stomachs. The traditional way to prepare ginger is by making a tea from the roots. Buy the roots, shave of the skins, and slice up enough to cover the bottom of a medium sized pan.

For those who are lucky enough not to have to stick to a budget, there is a wealth of choice from luxury carpets to pristine marble, glorious hardwood to natural stone. What types of Flooring are High Cost? As we all know, natural hardwood is one of the most expensive options for hard flooring. However, it will last the lifetime of the building if it is properly maintained and it is the only type of flooring that can be refinished. Other well-known expensive options are natural stones like Marble, slate, limestone, granite and flagstone. One way to reduce the cost of natural stone is to choose stone tiles instead, as this is made of stone aggregate that is suspended in polymer binder. Tiles can be an expensive option depending on their quality, materials and manufacture. Even carpet – usually thought of as the affordable choice – can be expensive depending on the type of fibres used. So what Bumps the Cost up? Like many other things in life, flooring will be more expensive if the material is hard to source or rare on the market and involves high cost and intensive labour to manufacture and process. Thus “hand-made” will cost significantly more than factory manufactured. Another factor in price is any artistic input, just as designer clothes will always bear a significant price tag. Installation also plays a large role in cost. Finally, flooring that is “fragile”, requiring special maintenance and after-care, will often cost more as well.', ""From Triggering Weight Loss To Balancing BP, Here Are Amazing Benefits Of Lychee Belly Fat Linked To Vitamin D Deficiency, Says New Study This Plan Can Help In Cutting The Risk Of Cancer By 40% How To Maintain Oral Hygiene With These 6 Tips This Diet Can Boost Fertility, A New Study Reveals Common Habits Which Can Harm These Particular Organs Of The Body!

[128] Dairy Main articles: Dairy cattle , Dairy farming , and Dairy Dairy farming and the milking of cattle was once performed largely by hand, but is now usually replaced by machine Certain breeds of cattle, such as the Holstein-Friesian , are used to produce milk , [129] [130] which can be processed into dairy products such as milk, cheese or yogurt . Dairy cattle are usually kept on specialized dairy farms designed for milk production. Most cows are milked twice per day, with milk processed at a dairy, which may be onsite at the farm or the milk may be shipped to a dairy plant for eventual sale of a dairy product. [131] For dairy cattle to continue producing milk, they must give birth to one calf per year. If the calf is male, it generally is slaughtered at a young age to produce veal . [132] They will continue to produce milk until three weeks before birth. [130] Over the last fifty years, dairy farming has become more intensive to increase the yield of milk produced by each cow. The Holstein-Friesian is the breed of dairy cow most common in the UK, Europe and the United States. It has been bred selectively to produce the highest yields of milk of any cow. Around 22 litres per day is average in the UK.

Paternal information (related to the sire and his ancestors) is found on the top half of the pedigree, and maternal information (related to the dam and her ancestors) is found on the bottom half of the pedigree. On an Official Holstein Pedigree, you will find: Registration names and numbers for all animals on the pedigree The birthdate of the animal Information on the animal’s current owner Estimates of genetic merit for all animals on the pedigree Any current classification scores for all animals on the pedigree Any official production records for females on the pedigree Any national show winnings or other awards received by animals on the pedigree Why are pedigrees important? Pedigrees can be useful to owners and breeders because information on an animal’s ancestors can help predict how well that animal may perform later in life; for example, how much milk they might produce, or how they will look, conformation-wise, based on how their ancestors performed in those areas. Aside from providing owners and breeders with a great deal of information about their animals, Official Holstein Pedigrees also serve as a verified source of ancestry, performance and genetic information when selling animals, giving the buyer trusted documentation that information presented on the animal is accurate.', ""£3.99 Read More Schleich Farm Life Holstein Bull Schleich Farm Life Holstein Bull Black and white Holstein bulls and cows are the most popular breed in the world.

The beef can be marketed as superior due to its marbled appearance. This has led to many markets, including Australia, Japan and the United Kingdom to adopt it into the mainstream. [17] Angus cattle can also be used in crossbreeding to reduce the likelihood of dystocia (difficult calving), and because of their dominant polled gene, they can be used to crossbreed to create polled calves. [24] Angus calf with its mother Commercial Edit Starting in the early 2000s, the American fast food industry began running a public relations campaign to promote the supposedly superior quality of Angus beef. Beginning in 2006, McDonald\'s commenced testing on hamburgers made with Angus beef in several regions in the US. After this test, the company said that customer response to the burgers was positive [25] and began selling the burger made with Angus beef in all US locations in July 2009. [26] In response to the test in the US, McDonald\'s Australia began selling two Angus burgers, the Grand Angus and the Mighty Angus, using Australian -bred Angus, in their restaurants. [27] The American Angus Association created the ""Certified Angus Beef"" (CAB) standard in 1978. The purpose of this standard was to promote the idea that Angus beef was of higher quality than beef from other breeds of cattle. Cattle are eligible for ""Certified Angus Beef"" evaluation if they are at least 51% black and exhibit Angus influence, which include black Simmental cattle and crossbreds. However, they must meet all 10 of the following criteria, which were refined in January 2007 to further enhance product consistency, in order to be labelled ""Certified Angus Beef"" by USDA Graders: [28]', 'Our Farm – Vilsiangus Aberdeen Angus Our Farm Cattle farming Gallery Cattle Sales Beef Cattle Contact Eesti keeles English Русский VILSI ANGUS Aberdeen Angus Our Farm Cattle farming Gallery Cattle Sales Beef Cattle Contact Eesti keeles English Русский Get to know the Aberdeen Angus beef cattle in Vilsi Angus breeding farm!

You will need a bull for this. When you only have one cow or two cows to care for, it is best to send them to a farm where another cattle farmer has a bull that is good enough to breed your cows. However, there is always risk that the bull may not be a calving-ease bull (or, a bull that has genetics for producing large calves, depending on the breed), or that the bull has reproductive disease like Trichomoniasis that could affect your cows. Jerseys, for instance, need to be bred to smaller calving-ease bulls like another Jersey bull or an Angus bull, because of their small size and inability to birth a large calf. If you do choose to have your cows bred naturally, you will need to either rent a bull for a couple months to stay on your place, or to give them up for a couple months to send them to a farm to get them bred.

Sarah here. When I met Brittany, one of the Chief Farmhands at Sugar Creek Two Farms, I got giddy with excitement at the prospect of a locally-grown, hormone-free, grass-fed (not finished, 100% grass-fed!) beef option. With local greens from The Rabbit’s Basket (where Sugar Creek Two Farms has set up shop) and now an accessible, healthy local option for beef…road trips to the nearest (read: 60+ miles away) Whole Foods, cooler in tow, might become a thing of the past. When Sugar Creek Two Farms then decided to work with us at Williams to create their branding, set up shop on social media, and get some Sugar Creek Two Farms swag…here’s what happened. We designed the Sugar Creek Two Farms logo with the main focus on the cattle. To hear Brittany talk about their process is to really learn how much time, effort and care goes in to raising 100% grass-fed fed cattle. These first-generation farmers see their cattle every.single.day. Because they practice rotational grazing, they are with their cattle every day, so they can monitor their herd of Angus/Charolais and Angus/Brahma and keep up with their needs and health.

This creates an impression that nicotine has very positive stimulating or calming effects – but it could not be further from the truth. Yes – a smoker reaches for a cigarette to achieve such a positive state, but they do so only because they have not supplied their body with nicotine and therefore feel irritated, nervous, distracted, and really cannot concentrate. Nicotine stimulates the central nervous system, but weakens and destroys the entire body. Cigarettes – why are they harmful? What do they contain? Why smoking cigarettes is so unhealthy? A cigarette itself contains a tobacco mixture made of prepared leaves of different tobacco varieties. All that is harmful is released when a cigarette is lit and the smoke is created. It is cigarette smoke that contains several thousand chemical substances that are toxic, addictive, and carcinogenic. Three of the best-known chemical substances are nicotine, tar, and carbon monoxide. Nicotine belongs to pyridinic alkaloids demonstrating strong addictive properties, it gets to the blood with cigarette smoke and affects all the internal organs, including: Central nervous system; Circulatory system; Digestive system. Besides nicotine, cigarette smoke contains carcinogenic tar and other toxic ingredients added during cigarette production.

I found that I could take something, and stop taking it at will. If withdrawal symptoms manifest, it is mild as compared to what I felt the first time I went cold turkey.

I quit cold turkey in 2015 with no problems using Allen Carr’s “EasyWay” method. I gradually started back up again, mainly from peer pressure from everyone from friends right down to my wife who felt awkward when we’d go out with friends and I was the only one not drinking. Fast forward to today – I’ve gone through the EasyWay book again and yesterday I had zero drinks mostly because the time change really messes with me and I slept about 14 hours. However, I’m also experiencing the highest stress point of my entire life. I’m concerned that staying abstinent vs. tapering gradually will just worsen my already unbearable anxiety. It’s a decision I have to make today since the house is very well stocked with beer wine and booze and I’ve gotten used to reaching for a cold one the same way someone might pop a xanax, to relieve the immediate and unbearable anxiety symptoms. I’m curious to get your thoughts on the two schools of thought: The EasyWay, Allen Carr method which says to quit cold turkey (and amazingly I had no withdrawal symptoms when I did that three years ago, but I also had no stress), and vs. the “HAMS” method of tapering.

The Whale Trail is working closely with the BC Cetacean Sightings Network and other groups to add new Whale Trail sites from Victoria to Prince Rupert. Interpretive panels will be installed at five locations this fall, and 30 sites in the southern Gulf Island will be marked with distinctive Whale Trail markers. East Point, Saturna Island was the first BC Whale Trail site, and the Shaw Ocean Discovery Centre in Sidney is the most recent. ""The Centre serves to inform people about the Salish Sea and our keystone mammal-- the orca,"" said Mark Loria, executive director of the Shaw Ocean Discovery Centre. ""Erich is an important figure in the world of orca conservation and protection and he will have much to share with our members and the public. Our partnership with Raincoast Conservation Foundation serves to strengthen our efforts in public programs and initiatives."" ""Erich is such a knowledgeable speaker about the sea. He clearly has a deep love for all that lives in there and it sparkles through in his talks,” said Maureen Welton of the Saturna Island Marine Research & Education Society. “He told us his exciting orca stories last year and we\'ve brought him back to talk about the unusual, little known species in the sea. His book is fascinating and we know his talk will be, too.""']"

(Supplied: Out of the Blue Adventures) A classic kill Jules Farrell, vice-president of the Organisation for the Rescue and Research of Cetaceans in Australia, said the kill off Ballina was classic orca behaviour. Ms Farrell said the animals followed the humpback pods, particularly on their southern migration to Antarctica when they were travelling with juveniles. ""They do travel in large groups. That\'s how they separate a calf from its mother and male escort. It\'s what they do,"" she said. What was unusual about this kill, she said, was the orcas devouring the entire calf instead of their usual practice of just eating the tongue and the cheeks as a \'delicacy\'. Photo: The orcas killed the juvenile humpback whale then ate it. (Supplied: Out of the Blue Adventures) Right place, right time Ms Farrell said given the vast distances travelled by the orcas and the speeds at which they travel, it was very unusual for humans to witness such an attack. ""For a whale-watching cruise to see this is really incredible."" Photo: The orcas came very close to the whale-watching boat. (Supplied: Out of the Blue Adventures) Skipper Dean Fuchs said the people onboard his tour boat were in awe of what they were seeing, but he wasn\'t sure if they appreciated its rarity.', 'Orcas adapt their strategies depending on their prey. Orcas primarily prey on young gray whale calves, which are vigorously defended by their mothers. Mother gray whales will interpose themselves between the orcas and their calves, and wave their mighty tales in an attempt to keep orcas away. They will also attempt to reach shallower water. If they are successful, the orcas will break off pursuit. Knowing this, the orcas will grab gray whales and attempt to drag them into deeper water, or cooperate to block the path to the shallows. When the orcas do catch a grey whale, they will kill it by drowning, holding the whale’s blowhole underwater until it expires. At this point, the key is timing. A whale carcass will sink. In water too deep, it will sink beyond the orcas’ reach. To prevent this, orcas work together to push a killed whale at the surface to prevent it from sinking, allowing the group more time to feed. They may also move a kill into water of appropriate depth, buying themselves more time. When a kill is made over deep water, the orcas may prioritize the parts that are most worthwhile or easiest to eat, such as the tongue. Time constraints are possible explanation for the focus on the sharks’ livers. Orcas adapt their strategies depending on their prey. There is evidence, for example, that when feeding on migratory tuna, orcas pursue a strategy specifically geared toward those fish. Tuna are fast swimmers, but physiological constrains how long a tuna can swim at top speed. Accordingly, the whales seemingly pursue some tuna just long enough to force the fish to exhaustion , at which point they can eat it. The technique only works on smaller tuna; for larger tuna the orcas either cooperate in the hunt, or, easier still, simply steal larger tuna from fishermen’s nets or longlines.']"

By Karen Hill Hopscotch was brought to Britain by the Romans, who used it as a military training exercise. The courses were one hundred feet long, and the soldiers ran them in full battle gear to improve their footwork. Children copied the soldiers by scratching out small courses of their own and creating rules and a scoring system. The scotch in hopscotch refers to the markings scored onto the ground.

They are often confused for being a whale because of their name ‘killer whale’, but did you know that orcas are actually dolphins? In fact, they are the largest member of the dolphin family! Orcas are incredibly popular as they are the most widely distributed of all whales and dolphins, found in every single ocean! They are very familiar with their black and white colouring but actually, depending on where they live, have very different appearances, behaviour, ways of communicating and diet! Find out some amazing facts below about the incredible orcas. Why are orcas called 'killer whales' when they are dolphins? Dolphins and whales are closely related. Orcas were given the name ‘killer whale’ by ancient sailors’ observations of groups of orcas hunting and preying on larger whale species. They called orcas asesina ballenas, or ‘whale killer’ – a term that was eventually flipped around to the easier ‘killer whale’. Their Latin name, Orcinus orca, also reflects this observation of orcas feeding on large whales. Orcinus translates to ‘of the kingdom of the dead,’ and orca refers to a kind of whale. We know that orcas are top predators, yes, but not the vicious ‘whale killers’ that the ancient mariners thought them to be. If you could give orcas another name, what would you call them?""]"

Two separate sightings of the orca pair near Barry\'s Head have been confirmed by the group, via photos provided by John Murphy and Richard Cussen on 5 March, during what is normally the \'low season\' for whale watching in Ireland. The pair comprises one adult male and a smaller whale which is likely an adult female. It is not yet known, however, whether the whales are new to Irish or Scottish waters. According to the IWDG\'s Pádraig Whooley, it is ""interesting that they have stayed close to their original position and suggests they may have found \'rich pickings\'"". In other news, the Whale and Dolphin Roadshow will be at the Galway Shopping Centre from 22-25 March in time for the European Cetacean Society Conference. The roadshow ""is a fantastic opportunity to learn more about whales, dolphins and porpoise of the ASCOBANS region"" that encompasses the Baltic Sea, Northeast Atlantic and Irish and North Seas. Published in Marine Wildlife Tagged under marine wildlife Irish Whale and Dolphin Group IWDG killer whales orca Barry\'s Head John Murphy Richard Cussen Irish waters', 'The Right Time. Another strategy is to go out looking when animals are most active. And I’m not just talking about dawn and dusk, when most (not all) animals are likely to be moving about. I’m also talking season. Fall is when many animals become active, and spring (or the start of wet season in Africa) is also good because many have their young and are thus forced to go out hunting, foraging or browsing to feed them. Also, the babies are irresistible. ‘Tis the Season. Seasonality also affects the ease with which you’ll be able to spot critters because of vegetation. For example going on safari in Africa during the dry season is popular because the general lack of green leafy growth on shrubs and trees of the savannah makes it easier to spot wildlife. Some wildlife during a specific season will ignore their natural instinct to avoid humans and come right down into our towns. In late fall, the elk of several western U.S. National Parks (Rocky Mountain and Grand Tetons for e.g.) descend from higher country and congregate in gateway towns like Estes Park, Colorado. Showing their Moves Animals move (I know, duh). And they move apparently without warning and in unpredictable ways. But really not so unpredictable once you observe and learn about them. STRATEGIES Ready & Steady. Be ever ready to move the camera instantly. It’s a mindset that is applicable to still photos of critters as well. Your positioning and stance needs to be such that you can swivel or pivot easily. I liken it to when I was a kid being coached on how to take a lead in baseball. You also need a way to smooth out your motions, covered in a previous post: Video on the Move.', 'An orca exposes its black-and-white belly to the air off the coast of San Juan Island, Wash., on Aug. 5, 1997.

Vancouver Island, Canada Summer is the best time to see orcas in the southern Georgia Strait between Vancouver Island and the mainland, just west of the San Juan Islands. You can leave from Victoria, Sooke and Sidney for whale-watching tours. The Johnstone Strait and the Broughton Archipelago off the island’s northeast coast also have resident orcas -- about 250. Tours (whale-watching boats or kayaks) leave from Port McNeill, Alert Bay and Telegraph Cove. Check out wildlife-viewing outfitters at British Columbia’s tourism website . 3. Southeastern Alaska In the southeastern part of Alaska, the best place to see orcas is in Resurrection Bay on the Kenai Peninsula. Whale-watching tours leave from Seward usually from May 5 to June 5, the sweet spot for seeing them. They’re usually feeding on a king salmon run at that time of year. Other killer whale hot spots can be found at Prince William Sound; along the Inside Passage for those on a cruise; and from the Kodiak to the Shumagin Islands.

Orca whales usually pass through the islands in greatest numbers between mid-May and mid-October when the salmon runs are strongest, although it\'s possible to spot them through the rest of the year. In February, March, April, late October, and November you can see 50% fewer whales than in the summer. However, keep in mind that every year is different depending on the ecosystem.

We just found orcas on the 19th, there’s been A LOT of humpbacks hanging around the area still, gray whales, fin whales, and lots of dolphins. The orcas were an amazing surprise on the 12:00 p.m. trip. The boat was watching a couple of fin whales when they spotted the orca off in the distance. They were traveling up along the coastline and were last spotted on the 19th near Palos Verdes. The male of the group is a fairly famous whale among orca enthusiasts; it was Fatfin (CA171B). His notable feature is his very large, wide dorsal fin, hence the name. Fatfin is a transient orca, meaning his ecotype is the mammal eating orca. If you’re a big fan of humpbacks and fin whales, they’ve been seen in good quantities lately. The humpbacks are all feeding and have been very friendly with our whale watches. And typically in the winter we get a higher incidence of fin whale sightings. The past week has been indicative of that, multiple sightings with 2 or more fin whales. So I’d suggest coming down to Long Beach to see some whales!']"

Two atoms of the same element bonded in a molecule do not form a chemical compound, since this would require two different elements. There are four types of compounds, depending on how the constituent atoms are held together: molecules held together by covalent bonds ionic compounds held together by ionic bonds intermetallic compounds held together by metallic bonds certain complexes held together by coordinate covalent bonds . A chemical formula specifies the number of atoms of each element in a compound molecule, using the standard abbreviations for the chemical elements and numerical subscripts . For example, a water molecule has formula H 2 O indicating two hydrogen atoms bonded to one oxygen atom. Many chemical compounds have a unique CAS number identifier assigned by the Chemical Abstracts Service . A compound can be converted to a different chemical composition by interaction with a second chemical compound via a chemical reaction . In this process, bonds between atoms are broken in both of the interacting compounds, and new bonds formed. Pure water (H 2 O) is an example of a compound: the ball-and-stick model of the molecule (above) shows the spatial association of two parts hydrogen (white) and one part(s) oxygen (red)', 'Chemical compounds have a unique and defined chemical structure held together in a defined spatial arrangement by chemical bonds . Chemical compounds can be molecular compounds held together by covalent bonds , salts held together by ionic bonds , intermetallic compounds held together by metallic bonds , or the subset of chemical complexes that are held together by coordinate covalent bonds . [7] Pure chemical elements are generally not considered chemical compounds, failing the two or more atom requirement, though they often consist of molecules composed of multiple atoms (such as in the diatomic molecule H 2 , or the polyatomic molecule S 8 , etc.). [7] Many chemical compounds have a unique numerical identifier assigned by the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS): its CAS number . There is varying and sometimes inconsistent nomenclature differentiating substances, which include truly non-stoichiometric examples, from chemical compounds, which require the fixed ratios. Many solid chemical substances—for example many silicate minerals —are chemical substances, but do not have simple formulae reflecting chemically bonding of elements to one another in fixed ratios; even so, these crystalline substances are often called "" non-stoichiometric compounds "". It may be argued that they are related to, rather than being chemical compounds, insofar as the variability in their compositions is often due to either the presence of foreign elements trapped within the crystal structure of an otherwise known true chemical compound , or due to perturbations in structure relative to the known compound that arise because of an excess of deficit of the constituent elements at places in its structure; such non-stoichiometric substances form most of the crust and mantle of the Earth. Other compounds regarded as chemically identical may have varying amounts of heavy or light isotopes of the constituent elements, which changes the ratio of elements by mass slightly.']"

Today’s world encourages fast food, packaged food and unhealthy food that leads to an unhealthy lifestyle. A healthy diet plan is one that comprises natural, fresh and rich foods taken daily. A balanced diet however is one that consists of various nutrients in the right proportion to supply the nutrient needs of the body. Problems arise when one tends to eat some kinds of food more than other kinds usually because on is your favorite food. In such cases a healthy balanced diet turns into unhealthy balance diet. Thus a balanced diet may be bad for you cause the diet may simply not supply the kind of nutrients that your body requires at that particular time. For example – if you are diabetic, hypertensive, or have a heart disease, a balanced diet may be unhealthy for you due to some kind of foods in the diet that makes it balance. It might be balanced but not for you. The same situation applies if you are weighing 400 pounds and a BMI of 41. While you must eat to stay alive, you need to avoid fatty and sugary foods as much as possible so an unbalanced or a healthy diet is what you need. People make these mistakes when they try to lose weight without doing enough research.

I have sister that was all state in track, basketball, and volleyball so I know but let's not act like these women are not extremely rare. These women practices does not compare to mens. These nfl and college players are doing more. And women do not lift like men lift stop lying you idiot. Men lift longer, harder and heavier. Most women that play sports are scared to get too big. And there's is nothing wrong with that but we don't need to compare mens and women's football cause it's not comparable Cassie Casimir 1 weeks back @Eddie N I did acknowledge the differences. And you're forgetting that there are differences between women as well. Athletic women exist. Women that play football generally like to lift too and just like men, you'll see women in the gym lifting and training for hrs a day too. What you're saying is that female athletes are not as good as men. I told you that I agreed to an extent. Yes, the best male football players are not as strong as the best female football players but if you are trying to quantify how hard women are training and how good they are by using men's physiques as the standard, then you are using an imbalanced scale. We know women and men have different biological and chemical makeup, and so we will never look or be the same are be as strong as each other. My bf and I could go to the gym everyday for the same amount of hrs and hed still gain more muscle than me bc his body is not meant to store fat in the same places I am. It doesnt take genius to know that we have different genetic makeup. But that being said, the best female athletes are faster and stronger than the general population of people, men and women. The average couch potato American watching pro female sports is not half as good as the women on the field. This is why women in the comments are calling you sexist by the way. You're completely denouncing how impressive these athletic women are bc they are not as good as the pro men in the same fields, which makes no sense bc pro men and pro women don't play against each other in the first place. Should they be paid the same as men? Well, the answer depends on whether they are logistically bringing in the same revenue as pro male football teams. If so, then yes. If not, then no. And if not, they will need to start to market women's pro football in a way to bring in higher ratings and conversions, in the same way they market all other sorts of bullshit to us."", '3. Women Don’t Have As Much Muscle Building Testosterone Testosterone is the male hormone that helps build muscle and burn fat, and as women, we have much less of it. Instead, we have higher levels of estrogen, which can keep us from building too much muscle or burning off too much fat. The key is to regulate estrogen and keep it normal and balanced. When estrogen is in excess, it can disrupt hormones, slow down metabolism and prevent fat burning. Keeping estrogen balanced can start with your diet. Eating plenty of fresh green vegetables like broccoli and kale, along with foods that are high in fiber like whole grains can help decrease estrogen metabolites that are toxic, reducing your overall estrogen load. Additionally, even though we may not have as much testosterone, women still have the same ability to build muscle as men. Protein synthesis occurs at the same rate in women, as it does in men. In fact, in one study, it was found that although testosterone levels were almost double in men post weight training than women, muscle protein synthesis was 2.7 times higher in women versus men. Bottom line: although we have less testosterone and more estrogen, we still can build muscle – so keep lifting! References: Blaak E, Gender differences in fat metabolism.

SEELÖWE was designed by John Michael Young, and published in 1974 by Simulations Publications, Incorporated (SPI). INTRODUCTION Hitler and members of the OKH. SEELÖWE is a quasi-historical (fantasy) simulation of the proposed, but never executed, German cross-Channel invasion of Britain in the fall of 1940. Unlike the majority of hypothetical situations that somehow show up as game designs, this one, at least, has some basis in fact. It is clear, for example, that — in the months immediately following France’s surrender — the OKH did at least consider the feasibility of a major seaborne attack against England. However, the German High Command believed, rightly, that such an amphibious operation was fraught with risk, even under the best of circumstances. Thus, the OKH and Hitler both concluded that, at a minimum, a cross-Channel assault against Britain would demand that two preliminary conditions be met before such an operation could be seriously even contemplated. First, such an invasion would require that the Luftwaffe decisively defeat the RAF and drive it out of range of the Channel Coast; and second, it would also require that the Germans devise a foolproof method for neutralizing the powerful British Royal Navy. An unfettered Royal Navy would represent an enormous danger to the initial German assault, and — even if the first landings were successful — to the Wehrmacht’s follow up efforts to reinforce and resupply German troops once they had gained a beachhead in England. Given the outcome of the “Battle of Britain” and the many other obvious risks, it is not difficult to see why Hitler decided not to invade Britain. Nonetheless, the tenuousness of the British military situation following the Allied evacuation from Dunkirk does make this hypothetical situation interesting. What would have happened if the preconditions for a German invasion had actually been met, and the Wehrmacht had managed to land on the English Coast in September 1940? John Young’s game, SEELÖWE, attempts to answer that question.', 'Home School Horses Kids Printables & Templates Senior Citizens Small Pets Teens Dogs Cats Dating & Relationships Teens Senior Citizens VIEW ALL CHANNELS Travel & Vacations Camping Cruises French San Francisco Theme Parks Travel Camping Travel Cruises Theme Parks French VIEW ALL CHANNELS Quizzes About Us Music POPULAR IN MUSIC Sites for Downloading Free Gospel Music Indie Music Music Artist and Industry Pictures Music Artists Music Downloads Music Genres Music Industry Insider Advice Music MP3 Players Playing Musical Instruments Rock Music Song Lyrics Indie Music Music Artist and Industry Pictures Music Artists Music Downloads Music Genres Music Industry Insider Advice VIEW ALL CATEGORIES Follow us: Privacy Policy Terms of Service Movies Teens Best Dance Guitar Cheerleading Music Music Genres British Invasion of the 1960s British Invasion of the 1960s By Heather McDonald The British Invasion of the 1960s would change popular music, fashion and even society forever.

Linux users usually obtain their operating system by downloading one of the Linux distributions, which are available for a wide variety of systems ranging from embedded devices (for example, OpenWrt ) and personal computers (for example, Linux Mint ) to powerful supercomputers (for example, Rocks Cluster Distribution ). A typical Linux distribution comprises a Linux kernel, GNU tools and libraries, additional software, documentation, a window system (the most common being the X Window System ), a window manager , and a desktop environment . Most of the included software is free and open-source software made available both as compiled binaries and in source code form, allowing modifications to the original software. Usually, Linux distributions optionally include some proprietary software that may not be available in source code form, such as binary blobs required for some device drivers . [1] A Linux distribution may also be described as a particular assortment of application and utility software (various GNU tools and libraries, for example), packaged together with the Linux kernel in such a way that its capabilities meet the needs of many users. [2] The software is usually adapted to the distribution and then packaged into software packages by the distribution's maintainers. The software packages are available online in so-called repositories , which are storage locations usually distributed around the world. [3] [4] Beside glue components, such as the distribution installers (for example, Debian-Installer and Anaconda ) or the package management systems, there are only very few packages that are originally written from the ground up by the maintainers of a Linux distribution."", 'There are several industry associations and hardware conferences devoted to maintaining and improving support for diverse hardware under Linux, such as FreedomHEC. Over time, support for different hardware has improved in Linux, resulting in any off-the-shelf purchase having a ""good chance"" of being compatible.[68] Uses Beside the Linux distributions designed for general-purpose use on desktops and servers, distributions may be specialized for different purposes including: computer architecture support, embedded systems, stability, security, localization to a specific region or language, targeting of specific user groups, support for real-time applications, or commitment to a given desktop environment. Furthermore, some distributions deliberately include only free software. As of 2015, over four hundred Linux distributions are actively developed, with about a dozen distributions being most popular for general-purpose use.[69] Desktop Visible software components of the Linux desktop stack include the display server, widget engines, and some of the more widespread widget toolkits. There are also components not directly visible to end users, including D-Bus and PulseAudio. The popularity of Linux on standard desktop computers and laptops has been increasing over the years.[70] Currently most distributions include a graphical user environment, with the two most popular environments being GNOME (which can utilize additional shells such as the default GNOME Shell and Ubuntu Unity), and the KDE Plasma Desktop. No single official Linux desktop exists: rather desktop environments and Linux distributions select components from a pool of free and open-source software with which they construct a GUI implementing some more or less strict design guide. GNOME, for example, has its human interface guidelines as a design guide, which gives the human–machine interface an important role, not just when doing the graphical design, but also when considering people with disabilities, and even when focusing on security.[71]', 'Samples of graphical desktop environments Cinnamon Common Desktop Environment (CDE) Enlightenment GNOME Shell (GNOME 3) KDE Plasma (KDE 5) LXDE MATE (GNOME 2) Pantheon Sugar Trinity (KDE 3) Unity Xfce Netbooks Linux distributions have also become popular in the netbook market, with many devices such as the ASUS Eee PC and Acer Aspire One shipping with customized Linux distributions installed.[82] In 2009, Google announced its Google Chrome OS, a minimal Linux based operating system which application consists only of the Google Chrome browser, a file manager and a media player.[83] The netbooks that shipped with the operating system, termed Chromebooks, started appearing in the market in June 2011.[84] Servers, mainframes and supercomputers Broad overview of the LAMP software bundle, displayed here together with Squid.

You generally know you have an overactive bladder if you have the sudden urge to urinate. This is also called urinary incontinence because you are basically experiencing the unintentional loss of urine. Causes of Having a Weak Bladder The main cause of weak bladders is muscle spasms in the bladder that make you feel like you need to urinate immediately. The major muscle involved in this process is called the detrusor. An adult bladder can hold up to 600cc of urine but the detrusor may signal the nervous system to urinate if there are 300cc of urine currently in the bladder. The detrusor muscle will contract and make you feel the sudden urge to urinate. *******weakbladder**** willmsith3211 Subscribe Unsubscribe 0 11 Mar 2011 952 Share Share Video Tweet Share on Facebook HTML-code: Copy Add Add to Watch Later Add to New Playlist...

Underestimate Hyperthyroid Symptoms at your peril. Indispensable to homosapians today, its influence on western cinema has not been given proper recognition. It is an unfortunate consequence of our civilizations history that Hyperthyroid Symptoms is rarely given rational consideration by the easily lead, who just don't like that sort of thing.

When Sir Bernard Chivilary said 'hounds will feast on society' [1] he borrowed much from Hyperthyroid Symptoms. No symbol is more potent than Hyperthyroid Symptoms in society today.

Aug 26 Posted by AJ In the wake of the international success of Guillermo del Toro’s latest movie, Pacific Rim, there has been a lot of chatter about the characterisation in the movie. Specifically, people have been talking about the characterisation of Mako Mori, the only female character of note in the movie. Many people have condemned her as a weak, ineffectual protagonist, while others have hailed her as a great example of strong representation of female characters in movies. I myself fall in the latter camp because I loved the character and I was able to look beyond what false trap that the character generates and consider her within the context of her culture and her own dialogue. You can read my thoughts on Mako in my review of the movie here.', 'Share Shares Copy Link Copy {copyShortcut} to copy Link copied!

Updated: 1:24 AM PDT Mar 31, 2019 By Emily Dixon and Gianluca Mezzofiore It\'s a shark-eat-shark world, as an Australian fisherman discovered this week.While fishing for small shark off the coast of New South Wales, Trapman Bermagui, also known as Jason, hooked a bronze whaler shark, which was promptly eaten by a colossal mako.Jason decided to attempt to bring in the large mako after it ate the bronze whaler. Before the huge shark could be hauled in, however, it fell prey to an even bigger creature, which devoured all but the mako shark\'s head.""We didn\'t see what ate the mako,"" Jason told CNN, estimating that the intact shark would have weighed ""at least"" 550 pounds. The head alone weighed about 220 pounds, he said.When the crew cut the meat from the mako\'s head, they found another surprise: the detached bill of a marlin, embedded into the flesh, which Jason speculated was the result of ""a battle years ago."" The find highlighted the ""amazing healing powers of the shark,"" he wrote on Facebook.Looking at the size of the shark -- and the bite taken out of it -- it\'s tempting to speculate that the mighty mako fell victim to some gargantuan ocean predator, one better suited to a Hollywood disaster movie.That might not have been the case, however. Jason speculated that the culprit was a tiger shark, telling CNN: ""There\'s so many around at the moment.""Tiger sharks are among the largest sharks in the ocean, according to Australia\'s Great Barrier Reef Foundation, growing to 10-16 feet long and weighing 800-1,500 pounds.Clive Trueman, associate professor in marine ecology at the University of Southampton in the United Kingdom, said the mako was probably unusually vulnerable because it was caught on the hook.""Once hooked, the struggles of a shark (or other fish) are likely to attract sharks and other predators,"" he told CNN. ""A hooked animal can be bitten by fish that might otherwise not be big enough to tackle it if it was free swimming.""Tyler Bowling, program manager at the Florida Program for Shark Research at the Florida Museum of Natural History, told CNN that the mako was probably attacked by a great white shark or similar.""Orcas will also attack large sharks to eat their livers, but the bite marks looked like that of a shark so probably a white shark,"" he said.As alarming as the photo may look, there\'s no cause for panic, according to Bowling. ""This type of thing happens a couple times a year,"" he said.', 'It\'s a shark-eat-shark world, as an Australian fisherman discovered this week.

In fact, sharks can see extremely well in dark lighted areas, have fantastic night vision, and can see colours. Avoid wearing bright colours in the water, such as oranges and yellows, as sharks can indeed see them. Are sharks always hungry? It has been observed that sharks can go up to approximately 6 weeks without feeding, and the record for a shark fasting was observed with the Swell Shark, in which it did not eat for 15 months. Sharks can enter what is called an ""eating phase"" which perhaps might constitute hunger, but on the grand scale of things, a shark is not always hungry. Are sharks considered to be fish? Sharks are fish. They live in water, and use their gills to filter oxygen from the water. Sharks are a special type of fish known because their body is made out of cartilage instead of bones like other fish. The classification of this type of fish is ""elasmobranch."" This category also includes rays, sawfish, and skates. Do sharks only eat meat? Sharks are omnivorous, which means they eat both meat and vegetation. Sharks will eat anything, and if there is not an abundant supply of meat in the area, they will resort to eating sea vegetation. The largest shark of all, the whale shark, is mainly a plankton feeder.', ""In the western Atlantic , it can be found from Argentina and the Gulf of Mexico to Browns Bank off of Nova Scotia . In Canadian waters, these sharks are neither abundant nor rare. Swordfish are good indicators of shortfin mako populations, as the former are a source of food and prefer similar environmental conditions. [17] Shortfin mako sharks travel long distances to seek prey or mates. In December 1998, a female tagged off California was captured in the central Pacific by a Japanese research vessel, meaning this fish traveled over 1,725 mi (2,776 km). Another specimen swam 1,322 mi (2,128 km) in 37 days, averaging 36 mi (58 km) a day. [18] Feeding [ edit ] The head of a mako shark The shortfin mako shark feeds mainly upon cephalopods and bony fish including mackerels , tunas , bonitos , and swordfish , but it may also eat other sharks, porpoises , sea turtles , and seabirds . They hunt by lunging vertically up and tearing off chunks of their preys' flanks and fins. Mako swim below their prey, so they can see what is above and have a high probability of reaching prey before it notices. In Ganzirri and Isola Lipari, Sicily , shortfin mako have been found with amputated swordfish bills impaled into their head and gills, suggesting swordfish seriously injure and likely kill them. In addition, this location, and the late spring and early summer timing, corresponding to the swordfish's spawning cycle, suggests they hunt while the swordfish are most vulnerable, typical of many predators. [15]"", 'Blue Sharks All sharks swim very fast, but the blue shark is one of the fastest species. Blue Sharks often look hungry due to the thin body they have. However, they are slender by nature and it has nothing to do with the amount of food they eat. Due to the roundness of most other types of sharks though they do seem quite on the thin side. They arenâ\x80\x99t picky at all about what they will eat though so they never go hungry. The blue shark is considered to be one of the most dangerous sharks in the waters. It has been known to attack people, which makes it one of species of shark that people most fear. Blue sharks can grow up to 12 feet long so this is no small shark to be trying to get away from. Due to the speed and the strength of it very few of its prey have a chance of survival. Read the Blue Shark Fact Sheet Great White Shark Probably the best known species of shark is the great white. This is believed to be the most dangerous type of shark in the world. People have been able to see them as they are among the rare species that do raise their heads out of the water. Great white sharks can grow up to 16 feet and weightÂ aroundÂ 1,500-2,400 pounds. Some have been known to weigh around 4,000 pounds but that isnâ\x80\x99t the norm.']"
